Time-varying spatial gradients within filaments affect net cross-shore fluxes of physical, biological, and chemical tracers but require high-resolution measurements to accurately estimate. In June 2017, the California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research program process cruise (P1706) conducted repeat sections by an autonomous Spray glider and a towed SeaSoar to investigate the role of one such coastal upwelling feature, the Morro Bay filament, which was characterized by enhanced cross-filament gradients (both physical and biological) and an along-filament jet. Within the jet, speeds were up to 0.78 m/s and the offshore transport was 1.5 Sverdrups (3.8 Sverdrups) in the upper 100 m (500 m). A climatological data product from the sustained California Underwater Glider Network provided necessary information for water mass differentiation. The analysis revealed that the cold, salty side of the filament carried recently upwelled California Undercurrent water and corresponded to higher chlorophyll-a fluorescence than the warm, fresh side, which carried California Current water. Thus, there was a convergence of heterogeneous water masses within the core of the filament’s offshore-flowing jet. These water masses have different geographic origins and thermohaline characteristics, which has implications for filament-related cross-shore fluxes and submesoscale-tomesoscale biological community structure gradients.","2021","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","13 pgs","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0495 Type: 10.1029/2020JC016602","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While rhizarians have been recently described as important contributors to both silica and carbon fluxes, we lack the most basic information about their ecological preferences. Here, using the in situ imaging (Underwater Vision Profiler 5), we characterize the vertical ecological niches of different test-bearing rhizarian taxa in the southern California Current Ecosystem. We define three vertical layers between 0-500 m occupied, respectively, by 1) surface dwelling and mostly symbiont-bearing rhizarians (Acantharia and Collodaria), 2) flux-feeding phaeodarians in the lower epipelagic (100-200 m), and 3) Foraminifera and Phaeodaria populations adjacent to the Oxygen Minimum Zone. We then use Generalized Additive Models to analyze the response of each rhizarian category to a suite of environmental variables. The models explain between 13 and 93% of the total variance observed for the different groups. While temperature and the depth of the deep chlorophyll maximum, appear as the main factors influencing populations in the upper 200 m, silicic acid concentration is the most important variable related to the abundance of mesopelagic phaeodarians. The relative importance of biotic interactions (e.g., predation, parasitism) is still to be considered, in order to fully incorporate the dynamics of test-bearing pelagic rhizarians in ecological and biogeochemical models.","2020","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0474; AR2020 Type: 10.1002/lno.11472","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine migration timing (inferred from the local onset and cessation of blue whale calls recorded on seafoor-mounted hydrophones), environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll a), and prey (spring krill biomass from annual net tow surveys) during a 10 year period (2008–2017) in waters of the Southern California Region where blue whales feed in the summer. Colder sea surface temperature anomalies the previous season were correlated with greater krill biomass the following year, and earlier arrival by blue whales. Our results demonstrate a plastic response of blue whales to interannual variability and the importance of krill as a driving force behind migration timing. A decadal- scale increase in temperature due to climate change has led to blue whales extending their overall time in Southern California. By the end of our 10-year study, whales were arriving at the feeding grounds more than one month earlier, while their departure date did not change. Conservation strategies will need to account for increased anthropogenic threats resulting from longer times at the feeding grounds.","2020","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","7710","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0475; AR2020 Type: 10.1038/s41598-020-64855-y","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C:234Th ratios of sinking particles collected by a surface-tethered sediment trap (C:234ThST) varied from 2.3 to 20.5 μmol C dpm−1 over a depth range of 47–150 m. C:234ThST was significantly greater (by a factor of 1.8) than C:234Th ratios of suspended >51-μm particles collected in the same water parcels with in situ pumps. C:234Th ratios of large (>200-μm) sinking particles also exceeded those of smaller sinking particles. C:234ThST decreased with depth from the base of the euphotic zone through the upper twilight zone. C:234ThST was positively correlated with several indices of ecosystem productivity including particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations, mesozooplankton biomass, and the fraction of Chl >20-μm. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression suggested that decaying phytoplankton blooms exhibited higher C:234ThST than actively growing blooms at similar biomass levels. C:234ThST was positively correlated with indices of the fractional contribution of fecal pellets in sediment traps when the proportion of fecal pellets was low in the traps, likely because of a correlation between mesozooplankton biomass and other indices of ecosystem productivity. However, when fecal pellets were a more important component of sinking material, C:234ThST decreased with increasing fecal pellet content. C:234ThST was also positively correlated with the Si:C ratio of sinking particles. Across the dataset (and across depths) a strong correlation was found between C:234ThST and the ratio of vertically-integrated POC to vertically-integrated total water column 234Th (vC:234Thtot). A mechanistic one-layer, two-box model of thorium sorption and desorption was invoked to explain this correlation. Two empirical models (one using vC:234Thtot; one using depth and vertically-integrated Chl) were developed to predict C:234Th ratios in this coastal upwelling biome. The former regression (log10(C:234ThST) = 0.43 × log10(vC:234Thtot) + 0.53) was found to also be a reasonable predictor for C:234ThST from diverse regions including the Southern Ocean, Sargasso Sea, Subarctic North Pacific, and Eastern Tropical North Pacific.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-15","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0428; AR2019 Type: 10.1016/j.marchem.2019.01.003","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We coupled a mechanistic thorium sorption and desorption model to a one-dimensional particle sinking model that uses realistic particle settling velocity spectra. The model generates estimates of 238Ue234Th disequilibrium, particulate organic carbon concentration, and the C:234Th ratio of sinking particles, which are then compared to in situ measurements from quasi-Lagrangian studies conducted on six cruises in the California Current Ecosystem. Broad patterns observed in in situ measurements, including decreasing C:234Th ratios with depth and a strong correlation between sinking C:234Th and the ratio of vertically-integrated particulate organic carbon (POC) to vertically-integrated total water column 234Th, were accurately recovered by models assuming either a power law distribution of sinking speeds or a double log normal distribution of sinking speeds. Simulations suggested that the observed decrease in C:234Th with depth may be driven by preferential remineralization of carbon by particle-attached microbes. However, an alternate model structure featuring complete consumption and/or disaggregation of particles by mesozooplankton (e.g. no preferential remineralization of carbon) was also able to simulate decreasing C:234Th with depth (although the decrease was weaker), driven by 234Th adsorption onto slowly sinking particles. Model results also suggest that during bloom decays C:234Th ratios of sinking particles should be higher than expected (based on contemporaneous water column POC), because high settling velocities minimize carbon remineralization during sinking","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","37-51","","","211","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0451; AR2019 Type: 10.1016/j.marchem.2019.03.005","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Euphausiid predators, such as blue whales, may become concentrated in the vicinity of these aggregations. We investigated an area called Nine Mile Bank (NMB) near San Diego, California, defined by an area of steep bathymetry, to determine whether the frequent whale sightings in that locality can be explained by the distribution of euphausiids across the bank and by the vertical distribution of euphausiids in the water column. Thysanoessa spinifera, the strongly preferred blue whale prey euphausiid in this area, was consistently more abundant on the bank or inshore of it than offshore. In contrast, Euphausia pacifica, a minor blue whale prey item, was much more abundant and distributed across the study region. Adults of both species were concentrated in a stratum corresponding to the feeding depth of blue whales. Other euphausiids that form a negligible part of the blue whale diet also showed no association with NMB. Both blue whales and their primary prey species Thysanoessa spinifera were more abundant on or inshore of the bank than offshore, suggesting that the bank may serve as an offshore limit of high prey abundance that helps to concentrate blue whales.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","390-405","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0425; AR2019 Type: 10.1002/lno.11047","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

F.","Spatial planning of Marine Aquaculture under Climate Decadal Variability: A case study for Mussel Farms in California","Frontiers of Marine Science","","","","","The growth of marine aquaculture over the 21st century is a promising venture for food security because of its potential to fulfill the seafood deficit in the future. However, to maximize the use of marine space and its resources, the spatial planning of marine aquaculture needs to consider the regimes of climate variability in the oceanic environment, which are characterized by large-amplitude interannual to decadal fluctuations. It is common to see aquaculture spatial planning schemes that do not take variability into consideration. This assumption may be critical for management and for the expansion of marine aquaculture, because projects require investments of capital and need to be profitable to establish and thrive. We analyze the effect of climate variability on the profitability of hypothetical mussel aquaculture systems in the Southern California Bight. Using historical environmental data from 1981 to 2008, we combine mussel production and economics models at different sites along the coast to estimate the Net Present Value as an economic indicator of profitability. We find that productivity of the farms exhibits a strong coherent behavior with marketed decadal fluctuations that are connected to climate of the North Pacific Basin, in particular linked to the phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). This decadal variability has a strong impact on profitability both temporally and spatially, and emerges because of the mussels’ dependence on multiple oceanic environmental variables. Depending on the trend of the decadal regimes in mussel productivity and the location of the farms, these climate fluctuations will affect cost recovery horizon and profitability for a given farm. These results suggest that climate variability should be taken into consideration by managers and investors on decision making to maximize profitability.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","253","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0449; AR2019 Type: 10.3389/fmars.2019.00253","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viruses are key players in ocean biogeochemical cycles6,7, yet little is known about how viral infection specifically impacts diatom populations. Here, we show that Si limitation facilitates virus infection and mortality in diatoms in the highly productive coastal waters of the California Current Ecosystem. Using metatranscriptomic analysis of cell-associated diatom viruses and targeted quantification of extracellular viruses, we found a link between Si stress and the early, active and lytic stages of viral infection. This relationship was also observed in cultures of the bloom-forming diatom Chaetoceros tenuissimus, where Si stress accelerated virus-induced mortality. Together, these findings contextualize viruses within the ecophysiological framework of Si availability and diatom-mediated biogeochemical cycling.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1790-1797","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0454; AR2020 Type: 10.1038/s41564-019-0502-x","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Canyons may be important to benthic-pelagic ecosystem coupling, but their role in concentrating plankton and structuring pelagic communities is not well known. We hypothesize that at the scale of a large marine ecosystem, canyons provide a critical habitat network, which maintain energy fow and trophic interactions. We evaluate canyon characteristics relative to the distribution and abundance of krill, critically important prey in the California Current Ecosystem. Using a geological database, we conducted a census of canyon locations, evaluated their dimensions, and quantifed functional relationships with krill hotspots (i.e., sites of persistently elevated abundance) derived from hydro-acoustic surveys. We found that 76% of krill hotspots occurred within and adjacent to canyons. Most krill hotspots were associated with large shelf-incising canyons. Krill hotspots and canyon dimensions displayed similar coherence as a function of latitude and indicate a potential regional habitat network. The latitudinal migration of many fsh, seabirds and mammals may be enhanced by using this canyon-krill network to maintain foraging opportunities. Biogeographic assessments and predictions of krill and krill-predator distributions under climate change may be improved by accounting for canyons in habitat models.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","7579","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0413; AR2018 Type: 10.1038/s41598-018-25742-9","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oceanogr.: Methods","","","","","We present the design and preliminary results from ocean deployments of Zooglider, a new autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider. Zooglider is a modified Spray glider that includes a low-power camera (Zoocam) with telecentric lens and a custom dual frequency Zonar (200 and 1000 kHz). The Zoocam quantifies zooplankton and marine snow as they flow through a defined volume inside a sampling tunnel. Images are acquired on average every 5 cm from a maximum operating depth of ~ 400 m to the sea surface. Biofouling is mitigated using a dual approach: an ultraviolet light-emitting diode and a mechanical wiper. The Zonar permits differentiation of large and small acoustic backscatterers in larger volumes than can be sampled optically. Other sensors include a pumped conductivity, temperature, and depth unit and chlorophyll a fluorometer. Zooglider enables fully autonomous in situ measurements of mesozooplankton distributions, together with the three-dimensional orientation of organisms and marine snow in relation to other biotic and physical properties of the ocean water column. It is well suited to resolve thin layers and microscale ocean patchiness. Battery capacity supports 50 d of operations. Zooglider includes two-way communications via Iridium, permitting near-real–time transmission of data from each dive profile, as well as interactive instrument control from remote locations for adaptive sampling.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0430; AR2019 Type: 10.1002/lom3.10301","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among them, giant siliceous rhizarians (>500 μm), including Radiolaria and Phaeodaria, are important contributors to oceanic carbon pools but little is known about their contribution to the marine silica cycle. We report the first analyses of giant phaeodarians to bSiO2 export in the California Current Ecosystem. We measured the silica content of single rhizarian cells ranging in size from 470 to 3,920 μm and developed allometric equations to predict silica content (0.37–43.42 μg Si/cell) from morphometric measurements. Using sediment traps to measure phaeodarian fluxes from the euphotic zone on four cruises, we calculated bSiO2 export produced by two families, the Aulosphaeridae and Castanellidae. Biogenic silica export ranged from <0.01 to 0.63 mmol Si · m 2 · day 1. These two families alone contributed on average 10% (range 0–80%) of total bSiO2 export from the euphotic zone. Their proportional contributions increased substantially in more oligotrophic regions with lower bSiO2 fluxes. Using the in situ Underwater Vision Profiler 5, we characterized vertical distributions of the giant phaeodarian family Aulosphaeridae to a depth of 500 m and inferred their contribution to bSiO2 export in deeper waters. We found a significant increase of Aulosphaeridae export (<0.01 to 2.82 mmol Si · m 2 · day 1) when extended to mesopelagic depths. Using a global data set of in situ profiles, we estimated the significance of Aulosphaeridae to bSiO2 export and revealed that they can act as major exporters of bSiO2 to the mesopelagic zone in various regions.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","987-1004","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0406; RR2018 Type: 10.1029/2018GB005877","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The North Pacific heat wave interacted with an El Niño developing in the equatorial Pacific in 2015. Weekly periods of exceptionally high temperature anomalies (>2˚C) occurred until the start of the El Niño (winter of 2015), when SSTs were still high but not as high as those due to the marine heat wave. During the 2015–16 El Niño, the depth of the 26.0 kg m–3 isopycnal (d26.0) was considerably shallower than during the 1982–83 and 1997–98 events. The area affected by the marine heat wave and the 2015–16 El Niño in the mixed layer was comparable to the 1997–98 El Niño, but lasted longer. Water column stratification in the upper 100 m during 2015–16 was as strong as the most extreme values during the 1997–98 El Niño. This stratification was primarily driven by the warming of the upper 100 m. Despite notable perturbations, the effects of the 2015– 16 El Niño on hydrographic properties in the CalCOFI domain were not as strong as those observed during the 1997–98 El Niño. Warm ocean conditions, stratification, nutrient suppression, and silicic acid stress likely favored initiation of a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom in fall 2014. Very low zooplankton displacement volumes were associated with anomalously warm and saline surface waters off Baja California. In contrast, during the 1997–98 El Niño, zooplankton volume was near average. Off California, pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) adults were abundant in the water column and frequently washed up on beaches of southern California from January 2015 into 2016, and central California by September 2015. Glider measurements of integrated transport up to June 2015 did not detect anomalous northward advection. As expected, HF radar indicated northward surface currents along the central California coast in fall and winter 2015–16. Northward advection appeared to be much stronger during the 1997–98 El Niño. Throughout 2015–16, the zooplankton community on the Oregon shelf was dominated by lipid-poor tropical and sub-tropical copepods and gelatinous zooplankton, indicating poor feeding conditions for small fishes that are prey for juvenile salmon. The presence of rarely encountered species increased copepod species richness during 2015–16 to levels higher than the 1998 El Niño. We infer that the unusual copepod vagrants of 2015–16 originated from an offshore and southwesterly source; an important difference from the southerly origin of vagrants during the 1997–98 El Niño. The very warm conditions caused sardine spawning to shift from central California to Oregon. Mesopelagic fish assemblage off southern California exhibited higher  abundances of species with southern affinities, and lower abundances of species with northern affinities. Forage fish (Pacific herring, northern anchovy, and Pacific sardine) were much less abundant in 2015–16 compared to previous years. In contrast, catches of salmon were close to average off northern California. Catches of young-ofthe- year rockfishes were high off central California, but low off both northern and southern California. Seabirds at Southeast Farallon Island in 2015 exhibited reduced breeding populations, reduced breeding success, lower chick growth rates, and lower fledging weights. Common murres were negatively affected in central and northern California, but seabird responses were species-specific. It is clear from the results presented here that the warm anomaly effects on the ecosystem were complicated, regionally specific, and that we do not fully understand them yet.","2016","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","5-62","","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0376; AR2017,FRII2017,RR2018","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oceans","","","","","The biological carbon pump is responsible for the transport of  5–20 Pg C yr21 from the surface into the deep ocean but its variability is poorly understood due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying planktonic processes. In fact, algorithms designed to estimate carbon export from satellite products incorporate fundamentally different assumptions about the relationships between plankton biomass, productivity, and export efficiency. To test the alternate formulations of export efficiency in remotesensing algorithms formulated by Dunne et al. (2005), Laws et al. (2011), Henson et al. (2011), and Siegel et al. (2014), we have compiled in situ measurements (temperature, chlorophyll, primary production, phytoplankton biomass and size structure, grazing rates, net chlorophyll change, and carbon export) made during Lagrangian process studies on seven cruises in the California Current Ecosystem and Costa Rica Dome. A food-web based approach formulated by Siegel et al. (2014) performs as well or better than other empirical formulations, while simultaneously providing reasonable estimates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing rates. By tuning the Siegel et al. (2014) algorithm to match in situ grazing rates more accurately, we also obtain better in situ carbon export measurements. Adequate representations of food-web relationships and grazing dynamics are therefore crucial to improving the accuracy of export predictions made from satellite– derived products. Nevertheless, considerable unexplained variance in export remains and must be explored before we can reliably use remote sensing products to assess the impact of climate change on biologically mediated carbon sequestration.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","7208–7222","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0343; AR2016 Type: 10.1002/2015JC011264","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to expectation, size-dependent rates for cells between 0.45 and 4.0 μm in diameter showed no systematic trends with cell size both in and among regions. For all size classes, mean ± SD growth rates ranged from −0.70 ± 0.17 to 0.83 ± 0.13 d−1 and grazing rates between −0.07 ± 0.13 and 1.17 ± 0.10 d−1. Taxon-specific growth rates for Prochlorococcus ranged from 0.17 ± 0.12 to 0.59 ± 0.01 d−1, for Synechococcus from 0.68 ± 0.03 to 0.97 ± 0.04 d−1, for picoeukaryotes from 0.46 ± 0.13 to 1.03 ± 0.06 d−1, and for all cells combined between 0.45 ± 0.03 and 0.65 ± 0.02 d−1. For grazing, Prochlorococcus rates ranged between 0.02 ± 0.12 and 0.66 ± 0.02 d−1, Synechococcus rates between 0.24 ± 0.08 and 0.92 ± 0.05 d−1, for picoeukaryotes between 0.19 ± 0.10 and 0.78 ± 0.09 d−1, and for all cells between 0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.75 ± 0.02 d−1. When comparing rates among taxa, only Prochlorococcus had consistently lower rates than Synechococcocus in all regions. No other trends were apparent.

Lo","State of the California Current 2012-13: No Such Thing as an “Average” Year","CalCOFI Reports","","","","","This report reviews the state of the California Current System (CCS) between winter 2012 and spring 2013, and includes observations from Washington State to Baja California. During 2012, large-scale climate modes indicated the CCS remained in a cool, productive phase present since 2007. The upwelling season was delayed north of 42˚N, but regions to the south, especially 33˚ to 36˚N, experienced average to above average upwelling that persisted throughout the summer. Contrary to the indication of high production suggested by the climate indices, chlorophyll observed from surveys and remote sensing was below average along much of the coast. As well, some members of the forage assemblages along the coast experienced low abundances in 2012 surveys. Specifically, the concentrations of all lifestages observed directly or from egg densities of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, and northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, were less than previous years’ survey estimates. However, 2013 surveys and observations indicate an increase in abundance of northern anchovy. During winter 2011/2012, the increased presence of northern copepod species off northern California was consistent with stronger southward transport. Krill and small-fraction zooplankton abundances, where examined, were generally above average. North of 42˚N, salps returned to typical abundances in 2012 after greater observed concentrations in 2010 and 2011. In contrast, salp abundance off central and southern California increased after a period of southward transport during winter 2011/2012. Reproductive success of piscivorous Brandt’s cormorant, Phalacrocorax penicillatus, was reduced while planktivorous Cassin’s auklet, Ptychoramphus aleuticus was elevated. Differences between the productivity of these two seabirds may be related to the available forage assemblage observed in the surveys. California sea lion pups from San Miguel Island were undernourished resulting in a pup mortality event perhaps in response to changes in forage availability. Limited biological data were available for spring 2013, but strong winter upwelling coastwide indicated an early spring transition, with the strong upwelling persisting into early summer.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","37-71","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0300","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depth profiles were taken across a 25-km transect of nine stations sampled semi-synoptically during one night and for 3 days following drifter arrays in the adjacent water masses. Community compositions are compared based on analyses by digital epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and pigment composition by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Our results show three assemblages sharply delineated in space, with plankton at the front being compositionally distinct and biomass elevated relative to either of the adjacent water masses. Depth-averaged chlorophyll a (Chl a) varied by a factor of 2.3 (0.35–0.81 mg Chl a L21) and autotrophic carbon (AC) varied almost 3-fold (13.6–35.4 mg C L21) across the front. One of the most striking features was a sharp gradient in the distribution of Prochlorococcus (PRO) and Synechococcus (SYN), with PRO located in the warmer oligotrophic waters on the south side of the front and SYN located in the cooler mesotrophic waters to the north. Both PRO and SYN had local biomass minima directly at the front. The peak in phytoplankton biomass at the front was dominated by large (.20 mm) diatom cells, comprising 71% of the total community biomass. In contrast to previous studies of frontal features in the southern California Current, our study of the A-Front shows strong frontal enhancement of phytoplankton biomass and a shift of phytoplankton size structure towards larger cells.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","778-789","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0208 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs036","","","","CCE; P0810; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Daily maps of fronts were averaged into monthly composites of front frequency (FF) spanning 29 years (1981–2009) for SST and 14 years (1997–2010) for Chl. The large-scale distributions of frontal frequency of both SST (FFsst) and of Chl (FFchl) had a 500–700 km wide band of elevated values (4–7%) along the coast that roughly coincided with the area of increased mesoscale eddy activity. FFsst and FFchl were positively correlated at monthly and seasonal frequencies, but the year-to-year variations were not significantly correlated. The long-period (1 year and longer) variability in FFsst is influenced by the large-scale SST gradient, while at shorter timescales the influence of the Coastal Upwelling Index is evident. In contrast with FFsst, FFchl variability is less related to the coherent large-scale forcing and has stronger sensitivity to local forcings in individual areas. Decadal-scale increasing trends in the frequency of both SST and Chl fronts were detected in the Ensenada Front area (general area of the A-Front study) and corresponded to, respectively, trends towards colder SST and increasing chlorophyll-a concentration.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","749-760","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0218 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs010","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CALCOFI; CCE; P0605; P0704; P0810; P1106; P1208; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P.","State of the California Current 2011-2012: Ecosystems respond to local forcing as La Niña wavers and wanes","CalCOFI Reports","","","","","The state of the California Current System (CCS) since spring 2011 has evolved in response to dissipation of La Niña through spring and summer, resurgence of cooler La Niña conditions in fall and winter, and finally a transition towards ENSO-neutral conditions in spring 2012. The resurgence of La Niña was uneven, however, as indicated by variable responses in broad climate indices such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the multivariate ENSO index, and by latitudinal variability in the timing, strength, and duration of upwelling relative to climatological means. Across the CCS, various measures of ecosystem productivity exhibited a general decline in 2011 relative to 2010, but the magnitude of these declines varied substantially among taxa. Available observations indicate regional variability in climate forcing and ecosystem responses throughout the CCS, continuing a pattern that has emerged with increasing clarity over the past several years. In 2011–12, regional variability was again a consequence of southern regions exhibiting a relatively mild response to climate forcing, in this case tending towards climatological means, while northern regions showed somewhat greater effects of delayed or weaker-than-normal upwelling. In addition to the effects of local and basin-scale forcing, long-term information from the tropical and northern Pacific Ocean. This review provides a broad temporal and spatial context for observations that focus more specifically on patterns and structure in physical forcing and responses at scales that span the entire CCS. Second, we summarize the state of the CCS in terms of available hydrographic and plankton data collected during repeated ship-based surveys that occupy designated stations at more or less regular intervals throughout the year (fig. 1). Third, building from our synthesis of the state of the ecosystem “base” of the CCS, we review data on abundance or productivity of several taxa at higher trophic levels based on observations from directed surveys or place-based study sites (fig. 2). Such taxa can respond to climate variability and change on multiple time scales, ranging from days to decades (Melin et al. 2010; Sydeman et al. 2012), and as such, may be useful as integrative indicators of ecosystem state. Finally, in the Discussion, we synthesize observations throughout the CCS to assess how the state of the CCS has evolved through the past year, and provide a look towards the future. effects of local and basin-scale forcing, long-term observations off southern California show declines in dissolved oxygen and increases in nutrient concentrations in waters below the mixed layer, trends that are consistent with recent predictions of how global warming will affect the characteristics of upwelling source waters in the CCS. Such trends must be accounted for more comprehensively in ongoing assessment of the state of the California Current and its responses to environmental forcing. At the time of writing, tropical conditions are ENSO neutral and forecast to transition into El Niño in late 2012. This, combined with unusually high abundances of diverse gelatinous taxa throughout much of the CCS during spring 2012, suggests that the ongoing evolution of the state of the California Current might take a particularly unusual path in the coming year.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","41-76","","","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0276","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to collect and synthesise existing pteropod (Gymnosomata, Thecosomata and Pseudothecosomata) abundance and biomass data, in order to evaluate the global distribution of pteropod carbon biomass, with a particular emphasis on temporal and spatial patterns. We collected 25 939 data points from several online databases and 41 scientific articles. These data points corresponded to observations from 15 134 stations, where 93% of observations were of shelled pteropods (Thecosomata) and 7% of non-shelled pteropods (Gymnosomata). The biomass data has been gridded onto a 360 × 180  grid, with a vertical resolution of 33 depth levels. Both the raw data file and the gridded data in NetCDF format can be downloaded from PANGAEA, doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.777387. Data were collected between 1950– 2010, with sampling depths ranging from 0–2000 m. Pteropod biomass data was either extracted directly or derived through converting abundance to biomass with pteropod-specific length to carbon biomass conversion algorithms. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the data were distributed quite evenly throughout the year, whereas sampling in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) was biased towards winter and summer values. 86% of all biomass values were located in the NH, most (37 %) within the latitudinal band of 30–60  N. The range of global biomass values spanned over four orders of magnitude, with mean and median (non-zero) biomass values of 4.6 mg Cm−3 (SD = 62.5) and 0.015 mgCm−3, respectively. The highest mean biomass was located in the SH within the 70–80  S latitudinal band (39.71 mg Cm−3, SD = 93.00), while the highest median biomass was in the NH, between 40–50  S (0.06 mg Cm−3, SD = 79.94). Shelled pteropods constituted a mean global carbonate biomass of 23.17 mg CaCO3 m−3 (based on non-zero records). Total biomass values were lowest in the equatorial regions and equally high at both poles. Pteropods were found at least to depths of 1000 m, with the highest biomass values located in the surface layer (0–10 m) and gradually decreasing with depth, with values in excess of 100 mg Cm−3 only found above 200m depth. Tropical species tended to concentrate at greater depths than temperate or high-latitude species. Global biomass levels in the NH were relatively invariant over the seasonal cycle, but more seasonally variable in the SH. The collected database provides a valuable tool for modellers for the study of marine ecosystem processes and global biogeochemical cycles. By extrapolating regional biomass to a global scale, we established global pteropod biomass to add up to 500 Tg C.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","167-186","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: External data user #3 Type: 10.5194/essd-4-167-2012 10.5194/essd-5-1-2013  (Corrigendum)","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo ?; External_data_user; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specific causal mechanisms have been difficult to unequivocally discover, but possible mechanisms include influences on habitat temperatures, productivity operating through bottom-up (trophodynamic) mechanisms or direct climate influence on the fish populations (top-down mechanisms). For small pelagic fishes (sardines and anchovies) in widely separated large marine ecosystems that lack obvious ocean interconnectivity, it has been argued that the teleconnections may be atmospheric, acting on the fishes directly and propagating to the ecosystem from the middle out (wasp-waist species). Zooplankton biomass or abundance time series data from >100 sites world-wide are used to examine the spatial scales of coherent temporal synchrony. If spatially correlated environmental factors (like climate) are important for creating synchrony in fish populations via bottom-up effects (trophic interactions involving fish prey, e.g., zooplankton), then we would expect to observe synchrony in fluctuations of zooplankton biomass/numbers at spatial scales similar to those found for fish species. Zooplankton biomass/abundance have 50% spatial decorrelation scales of ca. 700-1400 km and scales of significant coherence that extend to separation distances of ca. 3000 km. These are also the spatial scales of environmental (sea surface temperature) synchrony from our global analysis. These scales are slightly greater than the 50% decorrelation scales of ca. 150-700 km for recruitment synchrony in Atlantic marine fish and survival and recruitment synchrony of Northeast Pacific salmonids (150-1000 km depending on species). However, the spatial scales of synchrony of annual zooplankton biomass anomalies in the Humboldt Current, California Current and Kuroshio ecosystems of the Pacific are much too small (ca. 2000 km) to be directly causal of the basin-scale (7000-15,000 km) synchrony exhibited by sardine and/or anchovy populations in those ecosystems.

Glider observations show that upper ocean waters in the CCS were unusually warm and isopycnals were abnormally deep during the El Niño event, but indicate no anomalous water masses in the region. Observed oceanic anomalies in the CCS are nearly in phase with an equatorial El Niño index and local anomalies of atmospheric forcing.

The specific gravity of mesopelagic fish from the northeastern Pacific Ocean and its implications for acoustic backscatter. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: . Knowledge of the species present, their morphology, and their size distribution is required to infer biomass from acoustic surveys of fish. The gas content and specific gravity of the body (with gas removed), ρf, was measured for 71 species of mesopelagic fish in the NE Pacific Ocean. Those species that have functional swimbladders when large maintain constant ρf with increasing body size. Species without functional swimbladders as adults show decreased ρf with increasing body size. The acoustic-backscattering cross-section, σbs, was modelled for all individuals collected from three fish species that differed in the presence of a gas-filled swimbladder. The change in σbs with increasing body size was markedly different between the three. The low body density of those mesopelagic fish without gas-filled swimbladders greatly reduces their σbs. In species of fish that possess a functional swimbladder as juveniles and in which the swimbladder regresses with growth, the σbs first decreases, then increases with increased body size. Knowledge of the ontogenetic changes in swimbladder inflation and body density in mesopelagic fish is critical for the construction of the backscattering models used to interpret acoustic surveys.","2011","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","2064-2074","","10","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0215 Type: 10.1093/icesjms/fsr140","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model assumes allometric scaling of biological parameters. This particular version of the model (herbivorous zooplankton only) has analytical solutions that allow efficient exploration of the effects of allomeuic dependencies of various biological processes on the model's equilibrium solutions. The model shows that there are constraints on the possible combinations of allometric scalings of the biological rates that will allow ecosystems to be structured as we observe (larger organisms added as the total biomass increases). The diversity (number of size classes occupied) of the ecosystem is the result of simultaneous bottom-up and top-down control: resources determine which classes can exist; predation determines which classes do exist. Thus, the simultaneous actions of bottom-up and top-down controls are essential for maintaining and structuring planktonic ecosystems. One important conclusion from this model is that there are multiple, independent ways of obtaining any given biomass spectrum, and that the spectral slope is not, in and of itself, very informative concerning the underlying dynamics. There is a clear need for improved size-resolved field measurements of biological rates; these will both elucidate biological processes in the field, and allow strong testing of size-structured models of planktonic ecosystems.","2010-08","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1121-1130","","8","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0127 ISI:000280562300003 ISBN: 0142-7873 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbp145","","","","CCE LTER; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All time series were exactly dated and spanned 1972 through 1994. In a principal components analysis, the leading principal component (PC1bio) accounted for 64% of the variance in the data set. By entering the upwelling index, the Northern Oscillation index, sea surface temperatures, and the multivariate ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) index into principal components analysis, a time series of environmental variability PC1env was developed for each month of the year. Over the interval 1972 through 1994, PC1bio most strongly correlated with PC1env for February and, to a lesser extent, January and March. Moreover, when each of the six biological time series was related to the 12 PC1env through stepwise multiple regression, February was always the most significant (p < 0.01). The same was true if upwelling index was substituted for PC1env. As upper-trophic predators, rockfish and seabirds independently corroborate that wintertime ocean conditions are critical for productivity in the California Current ecosystem.","2010-07","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1149-1158","","7","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0152 ISI:000279739900009 ISBN: 0706-652X Type: 10.1139/f10-055","","","","CCE LTER; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this period, changes in the state of the CCS reflected a transition from cool La Niña conditions into and through a short-lived, relatively weak El Niño event. Weaker than normal upwelling and several extended relaxation events contributed to warming over much of the CCS during summer 2009, especially in the north. Moderation of La Niña conditions in the CCS coincided with the development of El Niño conditions in the equatorial Pacific, yet manifested well in advance of any evidence for direct effects of El Niño on the CCS. Responses to El Niño in fall 2009 and winter 2009–2010 appear to have varied substantially with latitude: conditions off southern California returned to near climatological values with the decline of La Niña, and did not indicate any subsequent response to El Niño, yet the northern CCS warmed subtantially following the decline of La Niña and was strongly affected by intense downwelling during winter 2009–2010. The 2009–2010 El Niño diminished rapidly in early 2010, and upwelling off central and southern California resumed unusually early and strongly for a spring following an El Niño, but recovery from El Niño in early 2010 appears to be less robust in the northern CCS. Thus, despite dynamic changes in the overall state of the California Current, 2009–2010 continued the recent pattern of strong regional variability across the CCS.","2010","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","39-69","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0257","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"IW735UNM","journalArticle","2007","Goericke, R.","The State of the California Current, 2006-207: Regional and local processes dominate","CalCOFI Reports","","","","","The state of the California Current System (CCS) between Oregon and Baja California is summarized in this report, covering spring 2006 to spring 2007. Observations reported here are based on contributions from various ocean observing programs along the West Coast of North America. Basin-scale indicators were variable or neutral over the last year. This indeterminate forcing was reflected in conditions in the CCS where no coherent patterns emerged, i.e., no single “state” could be ascribed to the system. Rather, regional or local processes dominated observed patterns. Similar to last year, delayed upwelling off Oregon and central California dramatically affected higher trophic levels: euphausiid recruitment was delayed and as a likely consequence seabird productivity off Central California was extremely depressed. For example, Cassin’s auklet had a complete reproductive failure, similar to 2006. Observations during the spring of 2007 demonstrate that these patterns were ephemeral since upwelling was normal and seabird productivity improved. Off southern and Baja California, upwelling-favorable winds were also weak or delayed during 2006, but biological consequences appear to have been relatively minor.","2007","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","33-66","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0277","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
