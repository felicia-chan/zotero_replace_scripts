S.","Improving plankton image classification using context metadata","Limnology and Oceanography - Methods","","","","","Advances in both hardware and software are enabling rapid proliferation of in situ plankton imaging methods, requiring more effective machine learning approaches to image classification. Deep Learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), show marked improvement over traditional feature-based supervised machine learning algorithms, but require careful optimization of hyperparameters and adequate training sets. Here, we document some best practices in applying CNNs to zooplankton and marine snow images and note where our results differ from contemporary Deep Learning findings in other domains. We boost the performance of CNN classifiers by incorporating metadata of different types and illustrate how to assimilate metadata beyond simple concatenation. We utilize both geotemporal (e.g., sample depth, location, time of day) and hydrographic (e.g., temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a) metadata and show that either type by itself, or both combined, can substantially reduce error rates. Incorporation of context metadata also boosts performance of the feature-based classifiers we evaluated: Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, Gradient Boosted Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Multilayer Perceptron. For our assessments, we use an original data set of 350,000 in situ images (roughly 50% marine snow and 50% nonsnow sorted into 26 categories) from a novel in situ Zooglider. We document asymptotically increasing performance with more computationally intensive techniques, such as substantially deeper networks and artificially augmented data sets. Our best model achieves 92.3% accuracy with our 27-class data set. We provide guidance for further refinements that are likely to provide additional gains in classifier accuracy.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","439-461","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0456; AR2020 Type: 10.1002/lom3.10324","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oceanogr.","","","","","Advances in in situ imaging allow enumeration of abundant populations of large Rhizarians that compose a substantial proportion of total mesozooplankton biovolume. Using a quasi‐Lagrangian sampling scheme, we quantified the abundance, vertical distributions, and sinking‐related mortality of Aulosphaeridae, an abundant family of Phaeodaria in the California Current Ecosystem. Inter‐cruise variability was high, with average concentrations at the depth of maximum abundance ranging from < 10 to > 300 cells m−3, with seasonal and interannual variability associated with temperature‐preferences and regional shoaling of the 10°C isotherm. Vertical profiles showed that these organisms were consistently most abundant at 100–150 m depth. Average turnover times with respect to sinking were 4.7–10.9 d, equating to minimum in situ population growth rates of ~ 0.1–0.2 d−1. Using simultaneous measurements of sinking organic carbon, we find that these organisms could only meet their carbon demand if their carbon : volume ratio were ~ 1 μg C mm−3. This value is substantially lower than previously used in global estimates of rhizarian biomass, but is reasonable for organisms that use large siliceous tests to inflate their cross‐sectional area without a concomitant increase in biomass. We found that Aulosphaeridae alone can intercept > 20% of sinking particles produced in the euphotic zone before these particles reach a depth of 300 m. Our results suggest that the local (and likely global) carbon biomass of Aulosphaeridae, and probably the large Rhizaria overall, needs to be revised downwards, but that these organisms nevertheless play a major role in carbon flux attenuation in the twilight zone.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","2579-2594","","6","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0407; RR2018, AR2018 Type: 10.1002/lno.10961","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined cross-frontal changes in mesopelagic fish assemblages at three separate frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) as part of the CCE Long Term Ecological Research program: the A-Front sampled in October 2008, the C-Front in June/July 2011, and the EFront in July/August 2012. We analyzed the differential effects of front-associated regions on density and species composition of adult migratory and non-migratory fishes and larvae, and the larval to adult ratio (as a possible index of a population growth potential) for migratory and non-migratory species. The fronts did not have a strong effect on densities of any subset of the mesopelagic fish assemblage. The species composition of the vertical migratory fishes (and their larvae) was typically altered across fronts, with different assemblages present on either side of each front. The migratory assemblages at the fronts themselves were indistinguishable from those at the more productive side of the frontal system. In contrast, the assemblage composition of the nonmigratory fishes was indistinguishable between regions across all three of the fronts. The differences between the Northern and Southern assemblages at the A-Front were primarily based on biogeographic provinces, while the assemblages at the E-Front were largely distinguishable by their oceanic or coastal-upwelling zone associations. These results generally confirm those of previous studies on frontal systems in the California Current Ecosystem and elsewhere. The ratio of larvae to adults, a potential index of population growth potential, was altered across two of the fronts for migratory species, elevated on the colder side of the A-Front and the warmer side of the EFront. This finding suggests that fronts may be regions of enhanced reproduction. The larvae to adult ratio was indistinguishable for non-migratory species at all three frontal systems. The non-migratory component of the community was little influenced by the presence of a front, apparently because the regions of strongest horizontal spatial gradients were too shallow to be experienced directly. We speculate that there was no change in larval community composition and population growth index at the most dynamic frontal system (C-Front) compared to the other fronts surveyed because the frontal feature was short-lived relative to the time scale for population growth of the fish. However, the difference in results of the C-Front may also be due to a change in methodology used in this study. If mesoscale features such as fronts increase in frequency off the California coast in the future as predicted, they have the potential to alter population growth potential and restructure mesopelagic fish assemblages, which are dominated by migratory species.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","80-91","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0422; AR2019 Type: 10.1016/j.dsr.2018.03.005","","","","CCE; P0810; P1106; P1208; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PDV is now recognized to consist of multiple ocean-atmosphere modes and to be caused by multiple processes. At the leading order, PDV can be viewed as the reddening process of stochastic atmospheric variability on the extratropical ocean. However, PDV is also strongly tied to teleconnection dynamics interacting with the tropics, primarily the interactions between meridional modes in the extra-tropics and ENSO, and between the ENSO teleconnections and the dominant modes of atmospheric variability in the mid-latitude.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","128-144","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0392; FRII2017, AR2018 Type: 10.1007/s40641-018-0090-5","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sea surface temperature (SST) observations show that the variance of the El Niño-like decadal variability has increased by 30% (1920-2015) with a stronger coupling between the major Pacific climate modes. Although we cannot attribute these trends to global climate change, the examination of 30 members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (LENS) forced with the RCP8.5 radiative forcing scenario (1920-2100) suggests that significant anthropogenic trends in Pacific decadal variance will emerge by 2020 in response to a more energetic North Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM)—a well-known El Niño precursor. The PMM is a key mechanism for energizing and coupling tropical and extratropical decadal variability. In the LENS, the increase in PMM variance is consistent with an intensification of the winds-evaporation-SST thermodynamic feedback that results from a warmer mean climate.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","983-991","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0398; AR2018 Type: 10.1002/2017GL076548","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ichthyoplankton surveys provide one approach to such monitoring. We conducted weekly fish egg collections off the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Pier (La Jolla, CA, USA) for 3 yr (2014 to 2017) and added a second sampling site near the La Jolla kelp forest for 1 yr (2017). Fish eggs were identified using DNA barcoding and data were compared to previous work from SIO Pier surveys from 2012 to 2014. We documented large interannual variability in fish egg abundance associated with climatic fluctuations, including an El Niño event captured during our sampling years. Overall egg abundance was reduced by >50% during periods of anomalously warm water in 2014 to 2016. Fish egg abundance rebounded in 2017 and was accompanied by a phenological shift of peak spawning activity. We found that interannual fish egg abundance may be linked with upwelling regimes and winter temperatures. Across the period of joint sampling, we found no distinct differences in community composition between the SIO Pier (soft bottom) and kelp forest habitat we sampled (2 km distant). Long-term monitoring of fish spawning can contribute to our understanding of how natural environmental variation, such as El Niño events, affects fish reproductive activity. This understanding may extend to trends in marine resource availability associated with climate and aid in evaluating the efficacy of existing management efforts.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","199-210","","","604","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0447; AR2019 Type: 10.3354/meps12738","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elevated particle flux at the front wasmechanistically linked to Fe-stressed diatoms and highmesozooplankton fecal pellet production.

The threat of domoic acid (DA) toxicity to human and wildlife health is the dominant harmful algal bloom (HAB) concern for the region, leading to a strong focus on prediction and mitigation of these blooms and their toxic effects. This paper describes the initial development of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping (C-HARM) system that predicts the spatial likelihood of blooms and dangerous levels of DA using a unique blend of numerical models, ecological forecast models of the target group, Pseudo-nitzschia, and satellite ocean color imagery. Data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) are applied to ocean color imagery to fill in missing data and then used in a multivariate mode with other modeled variables to forecast biogeochemical parameters. Daily predictions (nowcast and forecast maps) are run routinely at the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and posted on its public website. Skill assessment of model output for the nowcast data is restricted to nearshore pixels that overlap with routine pier monitoring of HABs in California from 2014 to 2015. Model lead times are best correlated with DA measured with solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) and marine mammal strandings from DA toxicosis, suggesting long-term benefits of the HAB predictions to decisionmaking. Over the next three years, the C-HARM application system will be incorporated into the NOAA operational HAB forecasting system and HAB Bulletin.","2016","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-18","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0410; AR2018 Type: 10.1016/j.hal.2016.08.006","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we combine observations with an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that teleconnections between the North Pacific and the weak 2014/2015 El Niño linked the atmospheric forcing patterns of this event. These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi-year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America.","2016","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1042-1048","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0374; AR2016 Type: 10.1038/nclimate3082","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These indices from experimentally weathered particles were compared to microplastic particles collected from oceanic surface waters in the California Current, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transition region between the two, in order to estimate the exposure time of the oceanic plastics. Although chemical bonds exhibited some nonlinear changes with environmental exposure, they can potentially approximate the weathering time of some plastics, especially high-density polyethylene.

Physical oceanographic data is assimilated into a Regional Ocean Modeling System implementation of the California Current System using an incremental 4-Dimensional Variational method. The resulting state estimate drives a complex, self-assembling ocean ecosystem model for the year 2003, and results are evaluated against SeaWiFS surface and CalCOFI subsurface observations and with ecosystem model output driven by an unconstrained physical model. While physical data assimilation improves correlation with observations, this method also drives elevated levels of phytoplankton standing stock, leading to a large bias particularly in regions of low mean concentration. We identify two causes for this increase: biological rectification of fluctuating vertical nutrient transport due to gravity wave generation at assimilation cycle initialization and increased nutrient variance on density surfaces. We investigate one and propose other possible remedies for these deleterious side-effects of this data assimilation method.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","546-558","","","138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0327; AR2015 Type: 10.1016/j.pocean.2015.01.004","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biomass of these fishes is a key parameter for ecological modeling of oceanic ecosystems, but it is poorly known. The two most common methods to estimate the biomass of these fishes, acoustic and trawl surveys, are both sensitive to the ability of fishes to avoid nets. We show that size-dependent changes in trawl capture efficiency can affect acoustic estimates of biomass estimates 5-fold. We used both acoustic and trawl-based methods (informed by morphological data and acoustic modeling of individual backscattering) to estimate the biomass of mesopelagic fishes of southern California to be 25–37 g m−2 of ocean surface, a comparable density to that of inshore epipelagic zooplanktivorous fishes. Our results indicate that mesopelagic fishes are likely to play a major role in regional food webs.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","129-142","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0288; AR2015 Edition: 18 October 2014 Type: 10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.10.007","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; CalCOFI; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A range of dFe-binding ligand classes was simultaneously determined using multiple analytical window analysis, involving titrations with multiple concentrations of the added ligand, salicylaldoxime. The highest dFe and ligand concentrations were determined in the low salinity end of the estuary, with dFe equal to 131.5nmolL−1 and strong ligand (log KFeL,Fe′cond≥12.0) concentrations equal to 139.5nmolL−1. The weakest ligands (log KFeL,Fe′cond11.0) were tightly coupled to dFe throughout the estuary, with average excess ligand concentrations ([L]–[dFe]) equal to 0.5nmolL−1. Humic-like substances analyzed via both CLE-ACSV and proton nuclear magnetic resonance in several samples were found to be a significant portion of the dFe-binding ligand pool in San Francisco Bay, with concentrations ranging from 559.5μgL−1 to 67.5μgL−1 in the lowest and highest salinity samples, respectively. DFe-binding ligands and humic-like substances were also found in benthic boundary layer samples taken from the shelf near the mouths of San Francisco Bay and Eel River, suggesting estuaries are an important source of dFe-binding ligands to California coastal shelf waters.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","183-194","","","173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0331; AR2015 Type: 10.1016/j.marchem.2014.11.005","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A small, variable salinity pond in the San Elijo Lagoon estuary in southern California was chosen to serve as a model pond due to its routinely high chlorophyll content. Profiles of microalgal assemblages from water samples collected from April 2011 to January 2012 were obtained by constructing 18S rDNA environmental clone libraries. Pond assemblages were found to be dominated by green algae Picochlorum sp. and Picocystis sp. throughout the year. Pigment analysis suggested that the two species contributed most of the chlorophyll a of the pond, which ranged from 21.9 to 664.3 μg · L−1 with the Picocystis contribution increasing at higher salinities. However, changes of temperature, salinity or irradiance may have enabled a bloom of the diatom Chaetoceros sp. in June 2011. Isolates of these microalgae were obtained and their growth rates characterized as a function of temperature and salinity. Chaetoceros sp. had the highest growth rate over the temperature test range while it showed the most sensitivity to high salinity.

To aid in the evaluation of recent ecosystem protection decisions in central-northern California, we designed and implemented multivariate ocean-climate indicators (MOCI) of environmental variability. To assess the validity of the MOCI, we evaluated interannual and longer-term variability in relation to previously recognized environmental variability in the region, and correlated MOCI to a suite of biological indicators including proxies for lower- (phytoplankton, copepods, krill), and upper-level (seabirds) taxa. To develop the MOCI, we selected, compiled, and synthesized 14 well-known atmospheric and oceanographic indicators of large-scale and regional processes (transport and upwelling), as well as local atmospheric and oceanic response variables such as wind stress, sea surface temperature, and salinity. We derived seasonallystratified MOCI using principal component analysis. Over the 21-year study period (1990–2010), the ENSO cycle weakened while extra-tropical influences increased with a strengthening of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and cooling of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Correspondingly, the Northern Oscillation Index (NOI) strengthened, leading to enhanced upwelling-favorable wind stress and cooling of air and ocean surface temperatures. The seasonal MOCI related well to subarctic copepod biomass and seabird productivity, but poorly to chlorophyll-a concentration and krill abundance. Our results support a hypothesis of enhanced sub-arctic influence (transport from the north) and upwelling intensification in north-central California over the past two decades. Such environmental conditions may favor population growth for species with sub-arctic zoogeographic affinities within the central-northern California Current coastal ecosystem.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","352-369","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0250; AR2014 Type: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.10.017__;!!Mih3wA!TIxBg1YeDlzeudIr0oPjTeSLeodmL844cEatr4iXGtRyAqBABOo358yp6pbhSQA$","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CALCOFI; P0605; P0704; P0810; P1106; P1208; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Links between deep-sea respiration and community dynamics","Ecology","","","","","It has been challenging to establish the mechanisms that link ecosystem functioning to environmental and resource variation, as well as community structure, composition, and compensatory dynamics. A compelling hypothesis of compensatory dynamics, known as ‘‘zero-sum’’ dynamics, is framed in terms of energy resource and demand units, where there is an inverse link between the number of individuals in a community and the mean individual metabolic rate. However, body size energy distributions that are nonuniform suggest a niche advantage at a particular size class, which suggests a limit to which metabolism can explain community structuring. Since 1989, the composition and structure of abyssal seafloor communities in the northeast Pacific and northeast Atlantic have varied interannually with links to climate and resource variation. Here, for the first time, class and mass-specific individual respiration rates were examined along with resource supply and time series of density and biomass data of the dominant abyssal megafauna, echinoderms. Both sites had inverse relationships between density and mean individual metabolic rate. We found fourfold variation in echinoderm respiration over interannual timescales at both sites, which were linked to shifts in species composition and structure. In the northeastern Pacific, the respiration of mobile surface deposit feeding echinoderms was positively linked to climatedriven particulate organic carbon fluxes with a temporal lag of about one year, respiring ;1– 6% of the annual particulate organic carbon flux.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1651-1662","","6","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0350; AR2016","","","","CCE; Published; Sta M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L.","Modeled diversity effects on microbial ecosystem functions of primary production, nutrient uptake, and remineralization","Ecology","","","","","Ecosystem-wide primary productivity generally increases with primary producer diversity, emphasizing the importance of diversity for ecosystem function. However, most studies that demonstrate this positive relationship have focused on terrestrial and aquatic benthic systems, with little attention to the diverse marine pelagic primary producers that play an important role in regulating global climate. Here we show how phytoplankton biodiversity enhances overall marine ecosystem primary productivity and other ecosystem functions using a self-organizing ecosystem model. Diversity manipulation numerical experiments reveal positive, asymptotically saturating relationships between ecosystem-wide phytoplankton diversity and functions of productivity, nutrient uptake, remineralization, and diversity metrics used to identify mechanisms shaping these relationships. Increase in productivity with increasing diversity improves modeled ecosystem stability and model robustness and leads to productivity rates that exceed expected yields primarily through niche complementarity and facilitative interactions between coexisting phytoplankton types; the composition of traits in assemblages determines the magnitude of complementarity and selection effects. While findings based on these aggregate measures of diversity effects parallel those from the majority of experimental outcomes of terrestrial and benthic biodiversity–ecosystem function studies, we combine analyses of community diversity effects and investigations of the underlying interactions among phytoplankton types to demonstrate how an increase in recycled production of non-diatoms through an increase in new production of diatoms drives this diversity–ecosystem function response. We demonstrate the important role that facilitation plays in the modeled marine plankton and how this facilitative interaction could amplify future climate-driven changes in ocean ecosystem productivity.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","153-163","","1","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0294; AR2014 Type: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0421.1__;!!Mih3wA!TIxBg1YeDlzeudIr0oPjTeSLeodmL844cEatr4iXGtRyAqBABOo358yp3CIBAwI$","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that recent high variability in demographic attributes of salmon and seabirds off California is related to increasing variability in remote, large-scale forcing in the North Pacific operating through changes in local food webs. Linear, indirect numerical responses between krill (primarily Thysanoessa spinifera) and juvenile rockfish abundance (catch per unit effort (CPUE)) explained >80% of the recent variability in the demography of these pelagic predators. We found no relationships between krill and regional upwelling, though a strong connection to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index was established. Variance in NPGO and related central Pacific warming index increased after 1985, whereas variance in the canonical ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation did not change. Anthropogenic global warming or natural climate variability may explain recent intensification of the NPGO and its increasing ecological significance. Assessing non-stationarity in atmospheric-environmental interactions and placing greater emphasis on documenting changes in variance of bio-physical systems will enable insight into complex climate-marine ecosystem dynamics.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1662 - 1675","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0224 Edition: 25 March 2013 Type: 10.1111/gcb.12165","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because such measurements are not routinely available, we developed predictive models of water-column (0–200 m) nitrate based on temperature for a region of the California Current System (30–47 N) within 50 km from the coast. Prediction was done using generalized additive models based on a compilation of 37,607 observations collected over the period 1959–2004 and validated with a separate set of 6430 observations for the period 2005–2011. A temperature-only model had relatively high explanatory power (explained deviance, D2¼71.6%) but contained important depth, latitudinal, and seasonal biases. A model incorporating salinity in addition to temperature (D2¼91.2%) corrected for the latitudinal and depth biases but not the seasonal bias. The best model included oxygen, temperature, and salinity (D2¼96.6%) and adequately predicted nitrate temporal behavior at two widely separated locations (44 39.10N and 32 54.60N) with slight or no bias [root-mean-square error (RMSE)¼2.39 and 0.40 mM, respectively). For situations when only temperature is available, a model including depth, month, and latitude as proxy covariates corrects some of the biases, but it had lower predictive skill (RMSE¼2.50 and 5.22 lM, respectively). The results of this study have applications for the proxy derivation of nitrate availability for primary producers (phytoplankton, macroalgae) in upwelling regions and for biogeochemical and ecosystem modeling studies.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-17","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0231 Type: 10.1002/jgrc.20216","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatially and temporally resolved CalCOFI sampling program has documented decadal changes in marine populations in a way that is unprecedented in the ocean. Though the fluctuations in chemical and biological properties were clear in the data, the dynamics underlying these variations were often not apparent. These long-term fluctuations are often a result of complex interactions between the atmospheric forcing, the ocean's physical response, and the integrative effects of the biological dynamics. It is difficult to move beyond simple correlations in analyzing these diverse data sets in the absence of a dynamical framework.  Coupled physical-chemical-biological models are excellent platforms for both synthesizing diverse data sets, and gaining understanding of the interactions among complex, nonlinear processes. Advances in computing power have enabled us to perform global-scale simulations with high regional-scale resolution. Combining such models with the long-term data set offered by programs such as CalCOFI and CCE-LTER gives us the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the atmospheric and oceanic forcings that result in the observed biological fluctuations. Here we describe some of the novel insights we have gained by using models to explore the physical-biological couplings underlying the interannual and decadal fluctuations observed in the CCS. We begin by describing the oceanic response to atmospheric forcing at basin scales, and the description of two dominant modes of atmosphere-ocean coupling: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Because the NPGO drives much of the low-frequency variability of nutrients in the CCS, we then explore the influence of the NPGO on planktonic ecosystems in the CCS at regional scales, and show how physical-biological interactions determine planktonic community structure. Finally we link these long-term changes in physical forcing to the intense biological dynamics found at frontal systems in the CCS.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","26-33","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0233 Type: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://dx.doi.org/__;!!Mih3wA!TIxBg1YeDlzeudIr0oPjTeSLeodmL844cEatr4iXGtRyAqBABOo358ypnBnwN_Q$  10.5670/oceanog.2013.42","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analyses focused on two species of particle-grazing copepods (Calanus pacificus and Eucalanus californicus) and two species of carnivorous chaetognaths (Sagitta bierii and Sagitta euneritica), drawing on the CalCOFI zooplankton time series from both the southern and central sectors of the California Current System. We detected a significant difference between regions in average stable N isotope content of the two species of copepods, with δ15N elevated by 0.5–1.1 per mil in the southern region, but no regional differences in the isotopic content of the chaetognaths. We address climate influences over a 54-year time period, on three different time scales: interannual (dominated by ENSO), decadal, and multi-decadal. Three of four species showed evidence of an ENSO-related isotopic shift toward increased 15N during El Niño conditions. In addition, in Southern California waters, C. pacificus and S. euneritica showed elevated δ15N in the warm phase of the NE Pacific between 1978 and 1998 relative to the preceding and following time periods. When considered over the entire 5½ decades treated here, for most species there was remarkable long-term stability in stable isotope content in both southern and central California waters, despite interannual and decadal perturbations. Only E. californicus in the southern sector showed a significant downward secular trend in δ15N. Variability of δ15N in 3 species covaried with the average nitrate concentration in the mixed layer, suggesting altered nitrate utilization at the base of the food web as a primary mechanism underlying interannual changes in zooplankton isotopic content.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","46-55","","0","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0196 ISBN: 0967-0637 Type: doi: 10.1016/j.dsr.2011.11.003, 10.1016/j.dsr.2011.11.003 (2012)","","","","CCE; California Current System; Chaetognaths; Climate change; Copepods; El Niño; Published; Stable N isotopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We characterized the A-Front with two novel devices, a free-fall Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) and an Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5), together with quantitative bongo samples analyzed by ZooScan. The MVP permitted real-time visualization of vertical density structure, chlorophyll a fluorescence and particle size structure (from a laser optical particle counter) across the front to a depth of 200 m with the research vessel moving at 6 m s21. The UVP5 quantified in situ vertical distributions from digital images of planktonic organisms and particles in profiles to 300 m. Both the MVP and UVP5 indicated that organic aggregates increased several-fold at the A-Front. The A-Front was a region of elevated abundance of mainly particle-grazing mesozooplankton, including calanoid copepods, Oithona spp., appendicularians and euphausiids, as well as a site of elevated ratio of nauplii copepod21. In contrast, poecilostomatoid copepods, ostracods, chaetognaths and radiolaria, most of which are more carnivorous or omnivorous, were all elevated in abundance to the south of the front. We provide evidence that submesoscale fronts can be regions of locally elevated plankton abundance and production, as well sites of faunal transitions.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","815-827","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0222 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs028","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are known to interact with biota on the individual level, e.g. through ingestion, but their population-level impacts are largely unknown. One potential mechanism for microplastic-induced alteration of pelagic ecosystems is through the introduction of hard-substrate habitat to ecosystems where it is naturally rare. Here, we show that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades, and that this increase has released the pelagic insect Halobates sericeus from substrate limitation for oviposition. High concentrations of microplastic in the NPSG resulted in a positive correlation between H. sericeus and microplastic, and an overall increase in H. sericeus egg densities. Predation on H. sericeus eggs and recent hatchlings may facilitate the transfer of energy between pelagic- and substrate-associated assemblages. The dynamics of hard-substrate-associated organisms may be important to understanding the ecological impacts of oceanic microplastic pollution.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","817-820","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0206 Type: 10.1098/rsbl.2012.0298","","","","CCE; Published; Supplement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three distinct autotrophic assemblages were identified. Fluorescence was found to be three to four times higher in cooler mesotrophic waters north of the front than in warm oligotrophic waters to the south. Northern waters were distinguished by a shallow pigment maximum dominated by a blue-water type of Synechococcus and by the presence of green-water Synechococcus and cryptophytes; only blue-water Synechococcus were detected at lower concentration south of the front. The highest Cchl and AC values, accompanied by elevated Fv/Fm and chlorophyll fluorescence per unit of Cchl, and minimal Synechococcus abundance, were found directly at the front in a 20–40 m deep layer dominated by diatoms. The covariation of Fv/Fm with nitrate concentration in this layer, along with the structural changes in the phytoplankton community, suggest that it had been generated by in situ processes rather than advection. Strong structural responses to the local hydrography were also revealed by high-frequency underway ALF surface sampling, which detected an abrupt transition from low to high SYN on the northern side of a sharp salinity gradient at the front. Synechococcus-specific phycoerythrin fluorescence (FPE12) and SYN were highly correlated in surface waters (R2= 0.95), while FPE12:SYN gradually increased with depth. Strong relationships were found for chlorophyll fluorescence versus Cchl (R2= 0.95) and AC (R2= 0.79).","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","761-777","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0209 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs034","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, ecosystem models often fail to agree with observations. This failure can be due to inadequacies in the data and/or inadequacies in the model formulation and parameterization. Here we parameterize and optimize a two-phytoplankton functional type model of phytoplankton growth rate and chlorophyll/ carbon (Chl:C) ratio using data from the Lagrangian field measurements conducted during process cruises of the Long-Term Ecosystem Research-California Current Ecosystem (CCE) program. We parameterize the model based on a small coastal subset of the data and then extend and test it with the full data set, including data from offshore regions. The CCE process studies were focused on quantifying the size-resolved planktonic growth, grazing, production, and export rates while following water parcels. The resulting data therefore provided strong constraints for the model we employed. The modeled growth rates and Chl: C ratios were in good agreement with observations. Our results indicate that the model can accurately predict Chl: C ratios, biomasses, and growth rates of dominant functional types using relatively easily measured environmental variables (temperature, nutrients, and bulk chlorophyll). The model also accurately reproduces the subsurface maxima of growth rates, the spatial separation of carbon and chlorophyll maxima, and many other observations in the California Current coastal and pelagic ecosystems.","2010-10","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","G04003","","","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0105 ISI:000282768500001 ISBN: 0148-0227 Type: 10.1029/2009jg001111","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying infrastructure development empirically not only in terms of spatial issues but also, and equally importantly, temporal ones, we illustrate how the long-term matters. Our case is about the collaborative development of a metadata standard for an ecological research domain. It is a complex example where standards are recognized as one element of infrastructure and standard-making efforts include integration of semantic work and software tools development. With a focus on the temporal scales of short-term and long-term, we analyze the practices and views of the main parties involved in the development of the standard. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) extension of the notion of infrastructure to more explicitly include the temporal dimension; 2) identification of two distinct temporal orientations in information infrastructure development work, namely 'project time' and 'infrastructure time', and 3) association of related development orientations, particularly 'continuing design' as a development orientation that recognizes 'infrastructure time'. We conclude by highlighting the need to enrich understandings of temporality in CSCW, particularly towards longer time scales and more diversified temporal hybrids in collaborative infrastructure development. This work draws attention to the manifold ramifications that 'infrastructure time', as an example of more extended temporal scales, suggests for CSCW and e-Research infrastructures.","2010-08","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","377-415","","3-4","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0163 ISI:000282318300007 ISBN: 0925-9724 Type: 10.1007/s10606-010-9113-z","","","","CCE LTER; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assess interannual variability in springtime abundances of zooplankton sampled in the epipelagic layer, using CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) zooplankton samples from two regions: Southern California (SC) and Central California (CC). Thecosome pteropods show no evidence of recent declines in abundance in SC or CC waters. In SC, sampling was sufficient to conclude that heteropods and large foraminifera also show no evidence of declines in abundance in recent years. These results do not preclude asyet undetected changes in vertical distributions or shell morphology, and underscore the importance of sustained in situ measurement programs in order to detect and understand changes to pelagic ecosystems.
