In these regions, nutrient upwelling occurs in a narrow region close to the coast, but primary production and carbon export are typically observed across a broader region. The fact that productive waters reach the open ocean has important consequences for the biological carbon pump, because such transport connects nutrient sources close to the coast to the deep carbon sinks of the offshore ocean. However, many aspects of this offshore transport are still not known. Here we address seasonal and interannual variability of upwelling-related cross-shore flows in the California current ecosystem (CCE) by employing Lagrangian diagnostics of horizontal transport inferred from satellite data. We define an advective age as the time a water parcel flowed offshore of the 500 m isobath. We find that the offshore extension of high Chl-a waters covaries with the age of a coastal water parcel, and is consistent with mesoscale circulation. Interannual variability in the offshore extent of older waters is primarily driven by mesoscale variability and covaries with large scale forcing by both ENSO and the NPGO. The measured ratio of in-situ new production: carbon export also covaries with water age, and tends to be ≫ 1 in younger and more balanced in older waters. Our results may help to parameterize the role of the finescale on the export of carbon in upwelling regions for climate resolving models.","2021","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","14 pgs","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribiution #0494 Type: 10.1029/2020JC016611","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, it is important to identify these fine-scale features and determine what generates their variability. Here we present evidence of fine-scale, tilted, interleaved layers in salinity and chlorophyll-a fluorescence observed in free-fall Moving Vessel Profiler surveys across a frontal system west of Point Conception, California. The observed covariability of hydrographic and biological properties allows for decomposition of the features into different water histories. Our analyses suggest that recently upwelled coastal water subsequently advected and intermingled with surrounding water masses from farther offshore. Orientations of the fine layers found in the filament are consistent with restratification and downwelling due to an ageostrophic secondary circulation brought on by frontogenesis. Finite size Lyapunov exponents, a Lagrangian diagnostic calculated from remote sensing data, provide positive evidence for frontogenetic convergence occurring upstream of the feature and allow for direct comparisons with in situ data to gauge their general utility in defining dynamical boundaries. These results highlight how frontal systems not only horizontally compress the biological niches represented by formerly disparate water masses but also create vertical structure and patchiness that can rapidly change over submesoscales.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0435; AR2019 Type: 10.1029/2018JC014645","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the contribution and variability of different biological sources to vertical export is not fully understood. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene and particle interceptor traps (PITs) to characterize the taxonomic composition of particles sinking out of the photic layer in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), a productive system with high export potential. The PITs included formalin-fixed and ‘live’ traps to investigate eukaryotic communities involved in the export and remineralization of sinking particles. Sequences affiliated with Radiolaria dominated the eukaryotic assemblage in fixed traps (90%), with Dinophyta and Metazoa making minor contributions. The prominence of Radiolaria decreased drastically in live traps, possibly due to selective consumption by copepods, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and phaeodarians that were heavily enriched in these traps. These patterns were consistent across the water masses surveyed extending from the coast to offshore, despite major differences in productivity and trophic structure of the epipelagic plankton community. Our findings identify Radiolaria as major actors in export fluxes in the CCE.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","964-976","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0409; AR2018 Type: 10.1038/s41396-018-0322-7","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 29-year record of in situ observations was used to examine episodic peaks in POC fluxes and sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC) at Station M (NE Pacific, 4,000-m depth). From 1989 to 2017, 19% of POC flux at 3,400 m arrived during high-magnitude episodic events (≥mean + 2 σ), and 43% from 2011 to 2017. From 2011 to 2017, when high-resolution SCOC data were available, time lags between changes in satellite-estimated export flux (EF), POC flux, and SCOC on the sea floor varied between six flux events from 0 to 70 days, suggesting variable remineralization rates and/or particle sinking speeds. Half of POC flux pulse events correlated with prior increases in EF and/or subsequent SCOC increases. Peaks in EF overlying Station M frequently translated to changes in POC flux at abyssal depths. A power-law model (Martin curve) was used to estimate abyssal fluxes from EF and midwater temperature variation. While the background POC flux at 3,400-m depth was described well by the model, the episodic events were significantly underestimated by ∼80% and total flux by almost 50%. Quantifying episodic pulses of organic carbon into the deep sea is critical in modeling the depth and intensity of POC sequestration and understanding the global carbon cycle.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","12235-12240","","48","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0426; AR2019 Type: 10.1073/pnas.1814559115","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These eddies contribute to intense, long-distance cross-shelf transport of upwelled water with enhanced biological activity. However, the mechanisms of formation of such coastal eddies, and more importantly their capacity to trap and transport tracers, are poorly understood. Their unpredictability and strong dynamics leave us with an incomplete picture of the physical and biological processes at work, their effects on coastal export, lateral water exchange among eddies and their surrounding waters, and how long and how far these eddies remain coherent structures. Focusing our analysis on the southern part of the CCS, we find a predominance of cyclonic eddies, with a 25-km radius and a SSH amplitude of 6 cm. They are formed near shore and travel slightly northwest offshore for ~ 190 days at ~ 2 km day−1 . We then study one particular, representative cyclonic eddy using a combined Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical approach to characterize its kinematics. Formed near shore, this eddy trapped a core made up of ~ 67% California Current waters and ~ 33% California Undercurrent waters. This core was surrounded by other waters while the eddy detached from the coast, leaving the oldest waters at the eddy’s core and the younger waters toward the edge. The eddy traveled several months as a coherent structure, with only limited lateral exchange within the eddy.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","761-777","","7","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0420; AR2018 Type: 10.1007/s10236-018-1158-4","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present the California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) for the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean over the past century, assimilating over 190 published records of predator food habits for over 100 predator species and 32 categories of forage taxa (species or groups of similar species). Literature searches targeted all predators that consumed forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate. Diet data were compiled into a relational database. Analysis of the CCPDD highlighted differences in predator diet data availability based on geography, time period and predator taxonomy, as well as prominent prey categories. The top 5 forage taxa with the most predators included juvenile rockfish, northern anchovy, euphausiid krill, Pacific herring and market squid. Predator species with abundant data included Pacific hake, common murre, and California sea lion. Most diet data were collected during the summer; the lack of winter data will restrict future use of the CCPDD to understand seasonal patterns in predator diet unless more such data become available. Increased synthesis of historical information can provide new resources to understand patterns in the role of forage species in predator diet. Increased publication and/or accessibility of long-term datasets and data-sharing will further foster the synthesis of information intended to inform the management, conservation and understanding of marine food webs.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","45-56","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0355; AR2016 Type: 10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.07.003","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While previous studies have identified the atmospheric variability of the Aleutian Low as an important driver of Ekman pumping and low-frequency SST anomalies, the role of subsurface gyre-scale dynamics remains unexplored. Using a set of reanalysis data sets from 1958 to the present, we find that subsurface temperature anomalies generated along the North Pacific Current significantly contribute through mean upwelling to decadal changes of SST in the Gulf of Alaska. This influence is comparable to the contribution associated with variations in atmospheric winds. Given the exceptional low-frequency character of the propagation of subsurface anomalies (e.g., multidecadal) along the gyre, monitoring subsurface temperature anomalies up stream along the North Pacific Current may enhance the decadal predictability of SST in the Gulf of Alaska and its impact on local marine ecosystems.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1488-1495","","5","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0333; AR2015 Type: 10.1002/2015GL063191","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While grazers and viruses are typically studied independently, their impacts on microbial communities may be complicated by direct and indirect interactions of their mortality effects. Using a modification of the seawater dilution approach, we quantified growth and mortality rates for total phytoplankton and picophytoplankton populations (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes) at four contrasting sites in the California Current Ecosystem. Grazing mortality was significant in 10 of 15 cases, while viral effects were significant for 2 cases. Nonetheless, mortality estimates for the entire phytoplankton community based on chlorophyll a were 38 ± 13% higher when viral effects were included, relative to grazing alone. Mortality estimates for picophytoplankton varied in space and among groups. We also explored a potential methodological constraint of this method and hypothesize that heterotrophic bacteria may be affected by the dilution of their growth-sustaining substrates. For all picophytoplankton, estimates of grazing and viral mortality were inversely related within and across experiments. Indirect interactions among grazers and viruses may be important to consider if there are tradeoffs in the grazing and virus resistance strategies of prey/host cells.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-17","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0315; AR2015 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbv011","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; P0810; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through decades of dedicated efforts and with the help of various satellite ocean-color missions, great progresses have been achieved in obtaining global PP as well as its spatial and temporal variations. However, there still exist wide differences between satellite estimations and in situ measurements, as well as large discrepancies among results from different models. The reasons for these large differences are many, which include uncertainties in measurements, errors in satellitederived products, and limitations in the modeling approaches. Unlike previous round-robin reports on PP modeling where the performance of specific models was evaluated and compared, here we try to provide a candid overview of three primary modeling strategies and the nature of present satellite ocean-color products. We further highlight aspects where efforts should be focused in the coming years, with the overarching goal of reducing the gaps between satellite modeling and in situ measurements.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","50-59","","","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0295; AR2015 Edition: 18 December 2014 Type: 10.1016/j.jmarsys.2014.11.015","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equilibrium-based near-steady state models and the “wasp-waist” paradigm for eastern boundary currents predict tightly-coupled trophic interactions, with negative correlations between the abundance of planktivorous competitors and between dominant planktivores and their prey. Testing these hypotheses with the CalCOFI time series, we found them to be generally invalid. Potential competitors within the mesopelagic community (planktivorous verticalmigrators (VMs) and non-migrators (NMs)) were highly positively correlated, as were these groups with the mesopelagic piscivores (e.g. dragonfishes) that prey on them. In addition, the abundance of VMswasmostly positively correlated with that of epipelagic planktivores, such as anchovy, mackerels and hake. The VMs and epipelagic planktivores were negatively correlated with key potential planktonic prey groups, indicating a lack of bottom-up forcing. However, neither do these negative correlations appear to signify top-down forcing, since they seem to be mediated through correlations with key environmental drivers, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), sea surface temperature, and the relative strength of the California Current.We suggest that the web of correlations linking key meso- and epipelagic planktivores, their predators and prey ismediated through common links with basin-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the PDO and ENSO cycles. Thus, the abundance of mesopelagic fishes in the California Current is closely tied to variation in the oxygen minimumzone, whose dynamics have been linked to the PDO. The PDO and other drivers are also linked to the transport of the California Current System, which influences the abundance of many dominant taxa off southern California that have broad biogeographic distributions linked to water masses that extend to the north (Transition Zone/sub-Arctic faunas) or the south (tropical/subtropical faunas).","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","20-28","","","138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0246; AR2015 Edition: 20 September 2013 Type: 10.1016/j.jmarsys.2013.09.007","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Calanoid copepod abundance (Ohman); Datazoo 153,155,166; Published; SWFSC icthyoplankton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A space-for-time exchange is one approach that permits use of natural spatial variability in the CCE to develop a mechanistic understanding needed to project future temporal changes.

In one set of experiments we measured incorporation of diatomC and coccoN into the macrofauna using isotopically enriched 13C-diatoms and 15N-coccolithophores. In a second experiment we measured incorporation of C and N from dual-labelled (13C and 15N) diatoms. The second experiment was repeated 2 months later to assess the effect of seasonality. The simulated food pulses represented additions of 650 – 800 mg C m22 and 120 mg N m22 to the seafloor. In all cases rapid incorporation of tracer was observed within 4 days, with between 20% and 52% of the macrofauna displaying evidence of enrichment. However, incorporation levels of both diatomC and coccoN were low (,0.05% and 0.005% of the added C and N). Incorporation of labelled diatoms was similar during both June and September suggesting that the community was not food limited during either period. We found no evidence for selective ingestion of the different food types in the metazoan fauna suggesting that macrofauna do not have strong preferences for diatom vs. coccolithophore dominated phytodetrital pulses. C:N ratios from both experiments suggest that the metazoan macrofauna community appear to have higher C demands and/or assimilation efficiencies compared to N. Concomitantly, the foraminifera preferentially selected for diatomN over coccoN, and we suggest that this may be related to foraminiferal requirements for intracellular nitrate. These experiments provide evidence that abyssal faunal feeding strategies are in part driven by an organism’s internal stoichiometric budgets and biochemical requirements.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","e80510","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0351; AR2016 Type: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080510","","","","CCE; Published; Sta M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change will alter the physico-chemical environment that reefs currently occupy, leaving only limited regions that are conducive to reef habitation. Identifying these regions early may aid conservation efforts and inform decisions to transplant particular coral species or groups. Here a species distribution model (Maxent) is used to describe habitat suitable for coral reef growth. Two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Earth System Model were used with Maxent to determine environmental suitability for corals (order Scleractinia). Environmental input variables best at representing the limits of suitable reef growth regions were isolated using a principal component analysis. Climate-driven changes in suitable habitat depend strongly on the unique region of reefs used to train Maxent. Increased global habitat loss was predicted in both climate projections through the 21<sup>st</sup> century. A maximum habitat loss of 43% by 2100 was predicted in RCP4.5 and 82% in RCP8.5. When the model is trained solely with environmental data from the Caribbean/Atlantic, 83% of global habitat was lost by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 88% was lost for RCP8.5. Similarly, global runs trained only with Pacific Ocean reefs estimated that 60% of suitable habitat would be lost by 2100 in RCP4.5 and 90% in RCP8.5. When Maxent was trained solely with Indian Ocean reefs, suitable habitat worldwide <italic>increased</italic> by 38% in RCP4.5 by 2100 and 28% in RCP8.5 by 2050. Global habitat loss by 2100 was just 10% for RCP8.5. This projection suggests that shallow tropical sites in the Indian Ocean basin experience conditions today that are most similar to future projections of worldwide conditions. Indian Ocean reefs may thus be ideal candidate regions from which to select the best strands of coral for potential re-seeding efforts. </p>","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","e82404","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0297 Type: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082404","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use field samples collected during a large natural environmental perturbation, the 1998–1999 alternation between El Nin˜o and La Nin˜a states, to test the ability of large dominant CCE zooplankton Euphausia pacifica and Calanus pacificus to alter their TPs in response to environmental variability. To distinguish trophic changes from variations of d15N values at the base of the food web, the zooplankton were assayed by Compound Specific Isotope Analysis of Amino Acids (CSIA-AA). Linear mixed-effect models were developed to utilize data from all amino acids (AAs), providing greater statistical power than the typical CSIA-AA approach of using only phenylalanine and glutamic acid. We confirm a significant 15N enrichment of , 2% at the base of the food web for all AAs and all zooplankton groups during the 1998 El Nin˜o. This baseline enrichment in 15N has been speculated to occur during El Nin˜o events but never conclusively shown. We also demonstrate a significantly elevated TP, implying increased carnivory during 1998, for E. pacifica while C. pacificus did not alter their TP between years. Lastly, TPs calculated from the standard CSIA-AA equation with laboratory-derived constants gave unrealistically low estimates, suggesting an assessment of these variables in situ is needed for an accurate application in natural systems.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","624-634","","2","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0230 Type: 10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0624","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Datazoo 78; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An enhanced understanding of these fluctuations could improve fisheries management and predictions of fish's responses to climate change. We investigated dynamic height as a variable for identifying the spawning habitat of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). During cruises between 1998 and 2004, dynamic height was calculated from temperature and salinity profiles, while fish egg concentration was measured with obliquely towed bongo nets and the Continuous, Underway Fish Egg Sampler. Dynamic height ranged between 68 and 108cm, with values increasing offshore. The greatest probability of encountering anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel eggs occurred at dynamic heights of 79–83cm, 84–89cm, and 89–99cm, respectively. Four mechanisms were proposed to explain how dynamic height affects egg distribution: (1) dynamic height is a proxy for upper water column temperature and salinity, which are known to influence spawning habitat. (2) Low dynamic heights are indicative of coastal upwelling, which increases primary and secondary productivity. (3) Egg concentration is greater at dynamic heights coincident with geostrophic currents that transport larvae to favorable habitats. (4) Eddies delineated by dynamic height contours retain eggs in productive habitats. To evaluate these mechanisms, a generalized linear model was constructed using dynamic height, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, zooplankton volume, geostrophic currents, and eddies as independent variables. Dynamic height explained more variance than any other variable in models of sardine and anchovy spawning habitat. Together temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll accounted for 80–95% of the dynamic height effect, emphasizing the importance of the first two mechanisms. However, dynamic height remained statistically significant in the models of anchovy and jack mackerel spawning habitat after considering the effects of all other variables. Dynamic height shows promise as an ecological indicator of spawning habitat, because it integrates the effects of multiple oceanic variables, can be remotely sensed, and is predicted by ocean circulation models.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","79-91","","0","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0229 ISBN: 0967-0637 Type: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr.2012.08.006__;!!Mih3wA!TIxBg1YeDlzeudIr0oPjTeSLeodmL844cEatr4iXGtRyAqBABOo358ypCSf4t2Y$","","","","CCE; CalCOFI; California Current; Datazoo 78; Dynamic height; Jack mackerel; Northern anchovy; Pacific sardine; Published; Sea surface height; Spawning habitat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only 12.9% of respondents agreed that global climate change is a possibility. In order to explain fishermen's divergent beliefs on climate change, a semiparametric discrete choice model is used to identify the potential determinants.

New Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solution methods have also called into question the biases of the commonly used L2 minimum norm (L2MN) solution technique. Here, we test the abilities of MCMC and L2MN methods to recover field-measured ecosystem rates that are sequentially excluded from the model input. For data, we use experimental measurements from process cruises of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE-LTER) Program that include rate estimates of phytoplankton and bacterial production, micro- and mesozooplankton grazing, and carbon export from eight study sites varying from rich coastal upwelling to offshore oligotrophic conditions. Both the MCMC and L2MN methods predicted well-constrained rates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing with reasonable accuracy, but the MCMC method overestimated primary production. The MCMC method more accurately predicted the poorly constrained rate of vertical carbon export than the L2MN method, which consistently overestimated export. Results involving DOC and bacterial production were equivocal. Overall, when primary production is provided as model input, the MCMC method gives a robust depiction of ecosystem processes. Uncertainty in inverse ecosystem models is large and arises primarily from solution under-determinacy. We thus suggest that experimental programs focusing on food web fluxes expand the range of experimental measurements to include the nature and fate of detrital pools, which play large roles in the model.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","20-33","","1","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0180 ISBN: 0924-7963 Type: doi: 10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.09.004, 10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.09.004","","","","CCE; California Current System; Ecosystem dynamics; Food web; Linear inverse model; Plankton; Published; Trophic structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sampled a frontal region (the A-Front) separating oligotrophic and mesotrophic water masses within the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) to assess the influence of frontal hydrography on several microbial parameters. Samples for heterotrophic bacterial, viral and flagellate abundance, dissolved and particulate carbon and nitrogen, transparent particles and bacterial carbon production were collected at 6 depths from the surface to 100 m with 5–9 conductivity/temperature/depth casts along a 26-km northerly transect across the front. Relative to adjacent oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters, the frontal transition displayed peaks in the mean estimates of cell-specific bacterial carbon and bulk bacterial production, particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen concentrations, and the abundance and size of transparent particles. Bacterial carbon production increased  5-fold northward from oligotrophic waters to the frontal zone, in agreement with an increase in the frequency of dividing cells, but bacterial abundance was lower than at adjacent stations. This may be partially explained by high chlorophyll, elevated virus:bacteria ratios and low nanoflagellate grazer abundance at the front. Our data suggest that CCE fronts can facilitate intense biological transformation and physical transport of organic matter, in sharp contrast to adjacent low productivity waters, and harbor dynamic microbial populations that influence nutrient cycling.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","802-814","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0211 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs048","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) Process studies in the southern California Current in October 2008, we sampled across a strong temperature and chlorophyll front (‘A-Front’) separating water masses with distinct hydrographic and biogeochemical characteristics and a modified biological assemblage at the frontal interface. Thorpe-scale analyses of the hydrographic data from a free-fall moving vessel profiler suggested an increased diapycnal diffusive nitrate flux at the front zone. Based on these field data, we use data-driven diagnostic biogeochemical models to quantify how the front-induced physical mixing influenced the production, grazing and transport of phytoplankton carbon in the southern California Current. Our results suggest that enhanced diffusive diapycnal fluxes of nutrients stimulated phytoplankton primary production at the front; this effect, together with reduced microzooplankton grazing, increased net growth of the phytoplankton community leading to locally enhanced biomass of large phytoplankton, such as diatoms, in the frontal zone.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","790-801","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0210 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs006","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using community-level growth and grazing data from dilution experiments, generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed to describe the effects of temperature and chlorophyll on m : μ. At low chlorophyll levels, m : μ decreases with increasing temperature, whereas at high chlorophyll levels, m : μ increases initially with temperature before reaching a peak and then declines. These complex responses of m : μ result from mixed effects of temperature and chlorophyll on microzooplankton biomass (Bz), biomass-specific microzooplankton grazing rate (m : Bz), and phytoplankton growth rate (μ). Bz decreases with rising temperature and increases with rising chlorophyll. m : Bz increases with temperature and decreases with chlorophyll. Nutrient-enriched growth rate of phytoplankton (μn) and μ increase with increasing temperature and chlorophyll. Holding chlorophyll constant, the calculated activation energies of m : Bz and μn are 0.67 ± 0.05 and 0.36 ± 0.05 eV, respectively, both consistent with previous MTE estimates for heterotrophs and autotrophs. Our study indicates that warming may enhance phytoplankton losses to microzooplankton herbivory in eutrophic but not in oligotrophic waters. The GAM analysis also provides important insights into underlying system relationships and reasons why community-level responses in natural systems may depart from theory based on laboratory data and individual species.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","519-526","","2","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0205 Type: 10.4319/lo.2012.57.2.0519","","","","CCE; Climate change; P0605; P0704; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test this hypothesis we use newly available data from the Argo array and compare it with a suite of well-known ecosystem indicators over 6 years, 2002 through 2007. We found increased biomass and productivity when the NPC was shifted poleward, and suggest that positioning influences advective transport of nutrients and perhaps key planktonic organisms from the sub-arctic domain thereby enhancing mid to upper trophic level species. This study is significant because climate change is predicted to cause poleward shifts in the westerlies that drive ocean currents and positioning of large marine gyre systems. Rather than reducing ecosystem productivity, poleward shifts in positioning of the NPC may be beneficial for many species of the central-northern CCE.","2011","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","L12606","","12","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0178 ISBN: 0094-8276 Type: 10.1029/2011gl047212","","","","4512 Oceanography: Physical: Currents; 4813 Oceanography: Biological and Chemical: Ecological prediction; 4815 Oceanography: Biological and Chemical: Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling (0439); 4830 Oceanography: Biological and Chemical: Higher trophic levels; CCE; Published; ecosystem indicators; northeast Pacific; salmon; seabirds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>, reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO<sub>2</sub>. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with <italic>a priori</italic> expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.</p>","2011","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","e28983","","12","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0201 Type: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028983","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altimetry since 1993 indicates that global MSL rise has increased about 50% above the 20th century rise rate, from 2 to 3 mm yr&#8722;1. At the same time, both tide gauge measurements and altimetry indicate virtually no increase along the Pacific coast of North America during the satellite epoch. Here we show that the dynamical steric response of North Pacific eastern boundary ocean circulation to a dramatic change in wind stress curl, &#964;xy, which occurred after the mid-1970s regime shift, can account for the suppression of regional sea level rise along this coast since 1980. Alarmingly, mean &#964;xy over the North Pacific recently reached levels not observed since before the mid-1970s regime shift. This change in wind stress patterns may be foreshadowing a Pacific Decadal Oscillation regime shift, causing an associated persistent change in basin-scale &#964;xy that may result in a concomitant resumption of sea level rise along the U.S. West Coast to global or even higher rates.","2011","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","C07005","","C7","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0185 ISBN: 0148-0227 Type: 10.1029/2010jc006759","","","","1620 Global Change: Climate dynamics (0429, 3309); 1637 Global Change: Regional climate change (4321); 3309 Atmospheric Processes: Climatology (1616, 1620, 3305, 4215, 8408); 4513 Oceanography: Physical: Decadal ocean variability (1616, 1635, 3305, 4215); 4556 Oceanography: Physical: Sea level: variations and mean (1222, 1225, 1641); CCE; Published; dynamical response; regional sea level rise; satellite altimetry; thermocline; tide gauge; wind stress curl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are also genetically diverse with at least 10 described clades and physiologically diverse capable of motility, using different sources of nitrogen or phosphorus, or modifying the composition of their photosynthetic pigments, for example. As more is learned of their diversity, however, it has become less clear how their genetic diversity reflects their physiological diversity and the ecological niches that they occupy. By developing novel, culture-independent methods, biogeographic patterns were uncovered to provide a framework to link the genetic, physiological, and ecological diversity of marine Synechococcus. Quantitative PCR was used to show that the coastal Southern California Bight is dominated by two Synechococcus clades. Relative to each other, the abundance of these clades varied seasonally indicating that they occupied distinct ecological niches. Synechococcus biogeography was explored further using a novel high-throughput hybridization method (Luminex) to examine the distribution of sub-clades within the two co-existing clades. Even at this scale of diversity, ecological differentiation was apparent. Most interestingly, in mesotrophic environments of the Southern California Bight a sub-clade was abundant in deep water (50 m) while most other sub-clades preferred surface waters. Environmental metagenomic sequences were used to investigate the role of selection in shaping the diversity of Synechococcus populations. The large majority of genes have evolved under purifying selection. Genes that were well represented in environmental populations and may be essential for the population in the coastal Southern California Bight tended to be more evolutionarily conserved. Genes that may have been positively selected were mostly hypothetical genes and were more rare in the environment. For this dissertation, the diversity, biogeography, and evolution of Synechococcus were examined at a level of detail not previously available. The results of this research formed a foundation for further investigations into the genetic and environmental factors regulating the ecological functions and niches of Synechococcus populations. More generally, this research addressed the scales at which bacterial evolution and diversification occur, and how bacterial populations are adapted to their environment.","2009","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Diego","San Diego","","","Ph.D.","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0162 Pages: 234 Volume: Ph.D.","","","","CCE Dissertations, Academic UCSD Marine biology; PhD_thesis; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
