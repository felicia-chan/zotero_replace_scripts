Conventional net sampling techniques are unable to resolve this vertical microstructure, while optical imaging systems can measure it for limited durations. Zooglider, an autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider, uses a low-power optical imaging system (Zoocam) to resolve mesozooplankton at a vertical scale of 5 cm while making concurrent physical and acoustic measurements (Zonar). In March 2017, Zooglider was compared with traditional nets (MOCNESS) and ship-based acoustics (Simrad EK80). Zoocam recorded significantly higher vertically integrated abundances of smaller copepods and appendicularians, and larger gelatinous predators and mineralized protists, but similar abundances of chaetognaths, euphausiids, and nauplii. Differences in concentrations and size-frequency distributions are attributable to net extrusion and preservation artifacts, suggesting advantages of in situ imaging of organisms by Zooglider. Zoocam detected much higher local concentrations of copepods and appendicularians (53 000 and 29 000 animals m−3, respectively) than were resolvable by nets. The EK80 and Zonar at 200 kHz agreed in relative magnitude and distribution of acoustic backscatter. The profiling capability of Zooglider allows for deeper high-frequency acoustic sampling than conventional ship-based acoustics.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,521-533,,4,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0455,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet planktonic organisms live suspended in a fluid medium and often bear elongate appendages, delicate feeding structures, and mucous houses that are badly damaged upon capture or removal from the fluid environment. Fixatives further distort organisms. In situ imaging of zooplankton from a fully autonomous Zooglider reveals a suite of trait characteristics that often differ markedly from those inferred from conventionally sampled plankton. In situ images show fragile feeding appendages in natural hunting postures, including reticulate networks of rhizopods, feeding tentacles of cnidarians, and tentilla of ctenophores; defensive spines and setae of copepods; intact mucous houses of appendicularians; and other structures that are not discernible in conventionally collected zooplankton. Postures characteristic of dormant copepods can be identified and the presence of egg sacs detected. Intact, elongate diatom chains that are much longer than measured in sampled specimens are resolvable in situ. The ability to image marine snow, as well as small-scale fluid deformations, reveals micro-habitat structure that may alter organismal  behaviour.

We developed or improved applications of 3 ecosystem modeling  approaches: Ecopath, Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE), and Atlantis. We also used Ecopath diets to predict impacts to predators using a statistical  generalization of the dynamic Ecosim model (Predator Response to the Exploitation of Prey [PREP]). Models that included brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis at the species level (MICE and Ecopath/PREP) both predict moderate to high vulnerability of brown pelicans to low sardine abundance. This vulnerability arises because sardine comprises a large fraction of their diet, and because other important prey (anchovy) also exhibit large population fluctuations. Two of the  ecosystem models (MICE and Atlantis) suggest that California sea lions Zalophus californianus exhibit relatively minor responses to sardine depletion, due to having broader diets and lower reliance on another fluctuating species, anchovy. On the other hand, Ecopath/PREP suggests that sardine declines will have a stronger impact on California sea lions. This discrepancy may in part reflect structural differences in the models: Atlantis and MICE explicitly represent density dependence and age-structure, which can mitigate effects of prey depletion in these models. Future work should identify fisheries management strategies that are robust to uncertainties within and among models, rather than relying on single models to assess ecosystem impacts of management and forage fish abundance.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,307-321,,,617-618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0412,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three species of copepods (Calanus pacificus, Metridia pacifica, and Eucalanus californicus) were incubated at sea in simulated in situ conditions to ascertain egg production rates and egg hatching success during a sequence of 3–5 California Current Ecosystem-Long Term Ecological Research (CCELTER) cruises across diverse ocean conditions. Several indices of food availability were measured. The warm events had no significant effect on egg production rates measured in the experiments conducted here. Egg production and net naupliar production rates varied markedly among copepod species and across spatial gradients, but relationships with food concentration during warm events did not consistently diverge from functional relationships during El Niño-neutral conditions. Egg production was most commonly elevated inshore compared to offshore, but was not elevated within fronts. The egg production of C. pacificus was best explained by total Chl-a, while E. californicus was best explained by the > 20 size fraction of Chl-a.

The recent occurrence of a warm anomaly (2014–2015) followed by an El Niño (2015–2016) in the southern sector of the California Current System presented an opportunity to analyze changes in the biological carbon pump in response to altered climate forcing. We compare primary production, mesozooplankton grazing, and carbon export from the euphotic zone during quasi-Lagrangian experiments conducted in contrasting conditions: two cruises during warm years - one during the warm anomaly in 2014 and one toward the end of El Niño 2016 – and three cruises during El Niñoneutral years. Results showed no substantial differences in the relationships between vertical carbon export and its presumed drivers (primary production, mesozooplankton grazing) between warm and neutral years. Mesozooplankton fecal pellet enumeration and phaeopigment measurements both showed that fecal pellets were the dominant contributor to export in productive upwelling regions. In more oligotrophic regions, fluxes were dominated by amorphous marine snow with negligible pigment content. We found no evidence for a significant shift in the relationship between mesozooplankton grazing rate and chlorophyll concentration. However, massspecific grazing rates were lower at low-to-moderate chlorophyll concentrations during warm years relative to neutral years. We also detected a significant difference in the relationship between phytoplankton primary production and photosynthetically active radiation between years: at similar irradiance and nutrient concentrations, productivity decreased during the warm events. Whether these changes resulted from species composition changes remains to be determined. Overall, our results suggest that the processes driving export remain similar during different climate conditions, but that species compositional changes or other structural changes require further attention.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,52-62,,,140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0404,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IKWQI9Z3,journalArticle,2018,"Lindegren, M.",Climate-mediated changes in marine ecosystem regulation during El Nino,Global Change Biology,,,,,"The degree to which ecosystems are regulated through bottom-up, top-down, or direct physical processes represents a long-standing issue in ecology, with important consequences for resource management and conservation. In marine ecosystems, the role of bottom-up and top-down forcing has been shown to vary over spatiotemporal scales, often linked to highly variable and heterogeneously distributed environmental conditions. Ecosystem dynamics in the Northeast Pacific have been suggested to be predominately bottom-up regulated. However, it remains unknown to what extent top-down regulation occurs, or whether the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down forcing may shift in response to climate change. In this study, we investigate the effects and relative importance of bottom-up, top-down, and physical forcing during changing climate conditions on ecosystem regulation in the Southern California Current System (SCCS) using a generalized food web model. This statistical approach is based on nonlinear threshold models and a long-term data set (~60 years) covering multiple trophic levels from phytoplankton to predatory fish. We found bottom-up control to be the primary mode of ecosystem regulation. However, our results also demonstrate an alternative mode of regulation represented by interacting bottom-up and top-down forcing, analogous to waspwaist dynamics, but occurring across multiple trophic levels and only during periods of reduced bottom-up forcing (i.e., weak upwelling, low nutrient concentrations, and primary production). The shifts in ecosystem regulation are caused by changes in ocean-atmosphere forcing and triggered by highly variable climate conditions associated with El Nino. Furthermore, we show that biota respond differently to major El Nino events during positive or negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), as well as highlight potential concerns for marine and fisheries management by demonstrating increased sensitivity of pelagic fish to exploitation during El Nino.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,796-809,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0397,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although total mesozooplankton carbon biomass was only modestly affected during El Niño springs, community composition changed substantially. Carbon biomass of five major zooplankton taxa correlated negatively with San Diego sea level anomaly (SDSLA), a regional metric of El Niño physical impacts in the CCS. Additional taxa were negatively related to SDSLA via a time-lagged response reflected in an autoregressive-1 (AR-1) model. All five SDSLAcorrelated taxa decreased in carbon biomass during most El Niño years compared to the surrounding years; the exception was the mild event of 2003. Principal Component Analysis revealed coherent species-level responses to El Niño within the euphausiids, copepods, and hyperiid amphipods. Percent similarity index (PSI) comparisons showed pronounced changes in the compositions of euphausiid and, to a lesser extent, calanoid copepod communities during El Niño. By grouping El Niños into Eastern Pacific (EP) versus Central Pacific (CP) events based on their expressions along the equator, we found that CCS zooplankton assemblages showed a tendency toward greater changes in species composition during EP than CP El Niños, although we had low statistical power for these comparisons. Several species showed consistent biomass changes across La Niña events as well, generally opposite in sign to El Niño responses, but overall community composition showed minimal change during La Niña.

Along oceanic eastern boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth’srotation combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a process calledEkman transport. Similarly,positive wind stress curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and consequently upwelling frombelow, a process known asEkman suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling of relativelynutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form thebase of the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies the calculation of upwelling indicessuch as the“Bakun Index”that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system studies. While generallyvaluablefirst-order descriptions, these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete pictureof coastal upwelling. Here we review the relevant dynamics and limitations of classical upwelling indices,particularly related to representation of the surface wind stress, the influence of geostrophic currents, and theproperties of upwelled water. To address these shortcomings, we present two new upwelling indices forthe U.S. West Coast (31–47°N), which are available from 1988 to present. The Coastal Upwelling TransportIndex and the Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index provide improved estimates of verticaltransport and vertical nitrateflux, respectively, by leveraging technological and scientific advances realizedsince the introduction of the Bakun Index nearly a half century ago.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,7332-7350,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0431,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison of conditions across the 154 positive frontal gradients (i.e., where density of the surface layer decreased in the offshore direction) identified from six years of continuous measurements showed that waters on the denser side of the fronts typically showed higher Chl-a fluorescence, shallower euphotic zones, and higher acoustic backscatter than waters on the less dense side. Transitions between these regions were relatively abrupt. For positive fronts the amplitude of Diel Vertical Migration (DVM), inferred from a 3-beam 750 kHz acoustic Doppler profiler, increased offshore of fronts and covaried with optical transparency of the water column. Average interbeam variability in acoustic backscatter also changed across many positive fronts within 3 depth strata (0–150 m, 150–400 m, and 400–500 m), revealing a front-related change in the acoustic scattering characteristics of the assemblages. The extent of vertical stratification of distinct scattering assemblages was also more pronounced offshore of positive fronts. Depth-stratified zooplankton samples collected by Mocness nets corroborated the autonomous measurements, showing copepod-dominated assemblages and decreased zooplankton body sizes offshore and euphausiid-dominated assemblages with larger median body sizes inshore of major frontal features.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,77-92,,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0317,,,,CCE; P0605; P0704; P0810; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results revealed that, between 2004 and 2010, coastal regions of mainland Tanzania inhabited by approximately 21% of the total population accounted for approximately 50% of the cholera cases and 40% of the total mortality. Significant co-variations were found between seasonally adjusted cholera cases and coastal ocean chlorophyll a and, to some degree, sea surface temperature, the outbreaks lagging behind by one to four months. Cholera cases in Dar es Salaam were also weakly related to the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index, lagging by five months, suggesting that it may be possible to predict cholera outbreaks for Dar es Salaam this period ahead.

BHZB4M62,journalArticle,2015,"de Verneil, A.",A pseudo-Lagrangian method for remapping ocean biogeochemical tracer data: Calculation of net Chl-a growth rates,J. Geophys. Res. Oceans,,,,,"A key goal in understanding the ocean’s biogeochemical state is estimation of rates of change of critical tracers, particularly components of the planktonic ecosystem. Unfortunately, because ship survey data are not synoptic, it is difficult to obtain spatially resolved estimates of the rates of change of tracers sampled in a moving fluid. Here we present a pseudo-Lagrangian transformation to remap data from underway surveys to a pseudo-synoptic view. The method utilizes geostrophic velocities to back advect and relocate sampling positions, removing advection aliasing. This algorithm produces a map of true relative sampling locations, and allows for determination of the relative locations of observations acquired along streamlines, as well as a corrected view of the tracer’s spatial gradients. We then use a forward advection scheme to estimate the tracer’s relative change along streamlines, and use these to calculate spatially resolved, net specific rates of change. Application of this technique to Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence data around an ocean front is presented. We obtain 156 individual estimates of Chl-a fluorescence net specific rate of change, covering !1200 km2. After incorporating a diffusion-like model to estimate error, the method shows that the majority of observations (64%) were significantly negative. This pseudo-Lagrangian approach generates more accurate spatial maps than raw survey data, and allows spatially resolved estimates of net rates of tracer change. Such estimates can be used as a rate budget constraint that, in conjunction with standard rate measurements, will better determine biogeochemical fluxes.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,4962-4979,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0342,,,,CCE; P1208; Process_cruise; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mesopelagic fish pose several challenges for acoustic biomass estimation based on their small size, wide depth range, mixed aggregations, and length-dependent acoustic reflectance, which differentiate them from the larger epipelagic and neritic fish for which these methods were developed. Foremost, there is a strong effect of depth on swimbladder resonance, so acoustic surveys of mesopelagic fish must incorporate depth-stratification. Additionally, the 1–3 cm juveniles of many species are not only more abundant, but can also be stronger acoustic backscatterers than the larger adults that comprise most of the biomass. The dominant species in terms of biomass may thus be weak acoustic backscatters. Failure to properly incorporate depth, the full size distribution, and certain less-abundant species into mesopelagic acoustic analyses could lead to errors in estimated biomass of up to three orders of magnitude. Thus, thorough validation, or “ground-truthing ”, of the species composition, depth structure, population size distribution, capture efficiency of the sampling device, and acoustic properties of the fish present is critical for credible acoustic estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass. This is not insurmountable, but requires more ancillary data than is usually collected.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1413–1424,,5,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0314,,,,CCE; Process_cruise; Published; SEAPLEX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G.",Climate change and decadal shifts in the phenology of larval fishes in the California Current ecosystem,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,"Climate change has prompted an earlier arrival of spring in numerous ecosystems. It is uncertain whether such changes are occurring in Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling ecosystems, because these regions are subject to natural decadal climate variability, and regional climate models predict seasonal delays in upwelling. To answer this question, the phenology of 43 species of larval fishes was investigated between 1951 and 2008 off southern California. Ordination of the fish community showed earlier phenological progression in more recent years. Thirty-nine percent of seasonal peaks in larval abundance occurred earlier in the year, whereas 18% were delayed. The species whose phenology became earlier were characterized by an offshore, pelagic distribution, whereas species with delayed phenology were more likely to reside in coastal, demersal habitats. Phenological changes were more closely associated with a trend toward earlier warming of surface waters rather than decadal climate cycles, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Species with long-term advances and delays in phenology reacted similarly to warming at the interannual time scale as demonstrated by responses to the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The trend toward earlier spawning was correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and mesozooplankton displacement volume, but not coastal upwelling. SST and upwelling were correlated with delays in fish phenology. For species with 20th century advances in phenology, future projections indicate that current trends will continue unabated. The fate of species with delayed phenology is less clear due to differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models in projected upwelling trends.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,E4065-E4074,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0347,,,,CALCOFI; CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun’s hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun’s hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,77-80,,6192,345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0323,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zooplankton biomass showed contrasting long-term patterns in the two regions: an increasing trend (as wet mass) in the NeAMS, but a decreasing trend (as displacement volume) in the SCC. Zooplankton biomass covaried with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the NeAMS, but with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation in the SCC. In the NeAMS, increasing zooplankton biomass was closely associated with increases of all major zooplankton groups (copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, and hyperiid amphipods). In the SCC, decreasing zooplankton biomass was caused by declining tunicates and chaetognaths. Seasonal cycles and responses to El Niño also differed between the two regions.

Nonlinearities in the system prevent a complete 30-day fit, so two 15-day fits for 1–15 November and 16–30 November are executed using the available observations of hydrographic temperature and salinity, along with satellite fields of SST and sea-level height anomaly. The fits converge and reduce the cost function significantly, and the results indicated that ROMS is able to successfully reproduce both large-scale and smaller-scale features of the flows observed during the VOCALS-REx cruise. Particular attention is focused on an intensively studied eddy at 76° W, 19° S. The ROMS fits capture this eddy as an isolated rotating 3-D vortex with a strong subsurface signature in velocity, temperature and anomalously low salinity. The eddy has an average temperature anomaly of approximately −0.5 °C over a depth range from 50–600 m and features a cold anomaly of approximately −1 °C near 150 m depth. The eddy moves northwestward and elongates during the second 15-day fit. It exhibits a strong signature in the Okubo-Weiss parameter, which indicates significant nonlinearity in its evolution. The heat balance for the period of the cruise from the ocean state estimate reveals that the horizontal advection and the vertical mixing processes are the dominant terms that balance the temperature tendency of the upper layer of the ocean locally in time and space. Areal averages around the eddies, for a 15-day period during the cruise, suggest that vertical mixing processes generally balance the surface heating. Although, this indicates only a small role for lateral advective processes in this region during this period, this quasi-instantaneous heat budget analysis cannot be extended to interpret the seasonal or long-term upper ocean heat budget in this region.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,3329-3344,,6,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0298,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutrient and gas fluxes, upwelling and downwelling, transport of biogeochemically important elements, predator-prey interactions, and other processes may be markedly influenced by such events, which are inadequately resolved from infrequent ship surveys. The advent of autonomous instrumentation, including underwater gliders, profiling floats, surface drifters, enhanced moorings, coastal high-frequency radars, and satellite remote sensing, now provides the capability to resolve such phenomena and assess their role in structuring pelagic ecosystems. These methods are especially valuable when integrated together, and with shipboard calibration measurements and experimental programs.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,18-25,,3,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0242,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the mixed layer, 17D of dissolved O2 (17Ddiss) ranged from 24 to 108 per meg and biological O2 saturation ranged from 101% to 113% for all regions and cruises. Mixed-layer 17D-GOP ranged from 49 6 23 mmol O2 m22 d21 to 533 6 185 mmol O2 m22 d21 with an annual mean for the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) grid of 151 6 59 mmol O2 m22 d21.

During another El Niño/Southern Oscillation transition period in 2006&#8211;2007 when the El Niño state retreated and the La Niña returned, a similar pattern in spawning habitat quality was seen. The coupling between the atmospheric forcing, the physical ocean states and the properties of the sardine egg spawning are investigated using dynamically consistent data-assimilation fits of the available physical oceanographic observations during these months. Fits were executed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional variational assimilation platform along with adjoint model runs using a passive tracer to deduce source waters for the areas of interest. Analysis using the data-assimilation model runs reveals that unusually strong equatorward wind-forcing drives offshore transport during the La Niña conditions, which extends the spawning habitat for sardine further offshore. A statistical model of sardine spawning habitat shows better habitat quality during the El Niño conditions, which is associated with higher egg densities and corresponded to higher daily egg production. Concentration of eggs is also increased by convergence of water. The results of the source waters analysis using the adjoint data assimilation model support the idea that offshore transport extends the spawning habitat, and show that higher levels of nutrient are brought into the spawning habitat with high concentration of sardine eggs.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,C03009,,C3,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0188,,,,"4260 Oceanography: General: Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis (3225); 4522 Oceanography: Physical: ENSO (4922); 4815 Oceanography: Biological and Chemical: Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling (0439); CCE; CalCOFI; California Current System; Datazoo 78; El Niño/La Niña; Published; data assimilation; sardine spawning habitats",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While several climatic fluctuation patterns influence the dynamics and biological productivity of the CCS, including the El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the mechanisms of interaction between climatic oscillations and the CCS upwelling dynamics have remained obscure. Here, we use Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to reveal, for the first time, low-frequency concordance between the time series of climatic indices and upwelling intensity along the coast of western North America. Based on energy distributions in annual, semiannual and low-frequency signals, we can divide the coast into three distinct regions. While the annual upwelling signal dominates the energy spectrum elsewhere, low-frequency variability is maximal in the regions south of 33uN. Non-structured variability associated with storms and turbulent mixing is enhanced at northerly locations. We found that the low-frequency signal is significantly correlated with different climatic indices such as PDO, NPGO and ENSO with the correlation patterns being latitude-dependent. We also analyzed the correlations between this upwelling variability and sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) throughout the North Pacific to visualize and interpret the large-scale teleconnection dynamics in the atmosphere that drive the low-frequency coastal winds. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms connecting climatic patterns with upwelling dynamics, which could enhance our prediction and forecast capabilities of the effects of future oceanographic and climatic variability in the CCS.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,13,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0183,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher abundance and biomass of vertically migratory mesopelagic fish (VMF) and euphausiids were found on the cooler mesotrophic (north) side of the front, whereas larval fish abundance was higher on the warmer oligotrophic (south) side. The biomass and community composition of non-VMF did not differ between the two sides of the front. The north was dominated by the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica and the myctophid Diaphus theta, whereas the south was dominated by E. gibboides, E. recurva and a combination of VMF species with warm water affinities. The larval fish assemblage in the north was dominated by the nearshore species Engraulis mordax and Citharichthys spp., whereas mesopelagic fish larvae dominated the south. Acoustic data revealed differences in the distribution of fish, euphausiids and the deep-scattering layer across the front. In particular, epipelagic fish were aggregated directly at the frontal interface in the area of enhanced plankton concentrations and may have contributed to higher plankton mortality and turnover rates at the front.

The resulting seven geographic habitats are stable to perturbations in types of data used in the cluster analysis. Based on recent coral reef survey data in the area, the coral cover was related to the identified geographic regions. The habitats tend to be geographically clustered, and each is characterized by a unique combination of oceanographic conditions. Previous studies suggest coral reef habitats are associated with a uniform array of oceanographic conditions, while our results demonstrate that finer-scale variations in physical variables may control coral reef environments.

In these regions, nutrient upwelling occurs in a narrow region close to the coast, but primary production and carbon export are typically observed across a broader region. The fact that productive waters reach the open ocean has important consequences for the biological carbon pump, because such transport connects nutrient sources close to the coast to the deep carbon sinks of the offshore ocean. However, many aspects of this offshore transport are still not known. Here we address seasonal and interannual variability of upwelling-related cross-shore flows in the California current ecosystem (CCE) by employing Lagrangian diagnostics of horizontal transport inferred from satellite data. We define an advective age as the time a water parcel flowed offshore of the 500 m isobath. We find that the offshore extension of high Chl-a waters covaries with the age of a coastal water parcel, and is consistent with mesoscale circulation. Interannual variability in the offshore extent of older waters is primarily driven by mesoscale variability and covaries with large scale forcing by both ENSO and the NPGO. The measured ratio of in-situ new production: carbon export also covaries with water age, and tends to be ≫ 1 in younger and more balanced in older waters. Our results may help to parameterize the role of the finescale on the export of carbon in upwelling regions for climate resolving models.",2021,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,14 pgs,,,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0494,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, it is important to identify these fine-scale features and determine what generates their variability. Here we present evidence of fine-scale, tilted, interleaved layers in salinity and chlorophyll-a fluorescence observed in free-fall Moving Vessel Profiler surveys across a frontal system west of Point Conception, California. The observed covariability of hydrographic and biological properties allows for decomposition of the features into different water histories. Our analyses suggest that recently upwelled coastal water subsequently advected and intermingled with surrounding water masses from farther offshore. Orientations of the fine layers found in the filament are consistent with restratification and downwelling due to an ageostrophic secondary circulation brought on by frontogenesis. Finite size Lyapunov exponents, a Lagrangian diagnostic calculated from remote sensing data, provide positive evidence for frontogenetic convergence occurring upstream of the feature and allow for direct comparisons with in situ data to gauge their general utility in defining dynamical boundaries. These results highlight how frontal systems not only horizontally compress the biological niches represented by formerly disparate water masses but also create vertical structure and patchiness that can rapidly change over submesoscales.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0435,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the contribution and variability of different biological sources to vertical export is not fully understood. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene and particle interceptor traps (PITs) to characterize the taxonomic composition of particles sinking out of the photic layer in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), a productive system with high export potential. The PITs included formalin-fixed and ‘live’ traps to investigate eukaryotic communities involved in the export and remineralization of sinking particles. Sequences affiliated with Radiolaria dominated the eukaryotic assemblage in fixed traps (90%), with Dinophyta and Metazoa making minor contributions. The prominence of Radiolaria decreased drastically in live traps, possibly due to selective consumption by copepods, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and phaeodarians that were heavily enriched in these traps. These patterns were consistent across the water masses surveyed extending from the coast to offshore, despite major differences in productivity and trophic structure of the epipelagic plankton community. Our findings identify Radiolaria as major actors in export fluxes in the CCE.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,964-976,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0409,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 2011 to 2017, when high-resolution SCOC data were available, time lags between changes in satellite-estimated export flux (EF), POC flux, and SCOC on the sea floor varied between six flux events from 0 to 70 days, suggesting variable remineralization rates and/or particle sinking speeds. Half of POC flux pulse events correlated with prior increases in EF and/or subsequent SCOC increases. Peaks in EF overlying Station M frequently translated to changes in POC flux at abyssal depths. A power-law model (Martin curve) was used to estimate abyssal fluxes from EF and midwater temperature variation. While the background POC flux at 3,400-m depth was described well by the model, the episodic events were significantly underestimated by ∼80% and total flux by almost 50%. Quantifying episodic pulses of organic carbon into the deep sea is critical in modeling the depth and intensity of POC sequestration and understanding the global carbon cycle.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,12235-12240,,48,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0426,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These eddies contribute to intense, long-distance cross-shelf transport of upwelled water with enhanced biological activity. However, the mechanisms of formation of such coastal eddies, and more importantly their capacity to trap and transport tracers, are poorly understood. Their unpredictability and strong dynamics leave us with an incomplete picture of the physical and biological processes at work, their effects on coastal export, lateral water exchange among eddies and their surrounding waters, and how long and how far these eddies remain coherent structures. Focusing our analysis on the southern part of the CCS, we find a predominance of cyclonic eddies, with a 25-km radius and a SSH amplitude of 6 cm. They are formed near shore and travel slightly northwest offshore for ~ 190 days at ~ 2 km day−1 . We then study one particular, representative cyclonic eddy using a combined Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical approach to characterize its kinematics. Formed near shore, this eddy trapped a core made up of ~ 67% California Current waters and ~ 33% California Undercurrent waters. This core was surrounded by other waters while the eddy detached from the coast, leaving the oldest waters at the eddy’s core and the younger waters toward the edge. The eddy traveled several months as a coherent structure, with only limited lateral exchange within the eddy.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,761-777,,7,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0420,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present the California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) for the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean over the past century, assimilating over 190 published records of predator food habits for over 100 predator species and 32 categories of forage taxa (species or groups of similar species). Literature searches targeted all predators that consumed forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate. Diet data were compiled into a relational database. Analysis of the CCPDD highlighted differences in predator diet data availability based on geography, time period and predator taxonomy, as well as prominent prey categories. The top 5 forage taxa with the most predators included juvenile rockfish, northern anchovy, euphausiid krill, Pacific herring and market squid. Predator species with abundant data included Pacific hake, common murre, and California sea lion. Most diet data were collected during the summer; the lack of winter data will restrict future use of the CCPDD to understand seasonal patterns in predator diet unless more such data become available. Increased synthesis of historical information can provide new resources to understand patterns in the role of forage species in predator diet. Increased publication and/or accessibility of long-term datasets and data-sharing will further foster the synthesis of information intended to inform the management, conservation and understanding of marine food webs.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,45-56,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0355,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While previous studies have identified the atmospheric variability of the Aleutian Low as an important driver of Ekman pumping and low-frequency SST anomalies, the role of subsurface gyre-scale dynamics remains unexplored. Using a set of reanalysis data sets from 1958 to the present, we find that subsurface temperature anomalies generated along the North Pacific Current significantly contribute through mean upwelling to decadal changes of SST in the Gulf of Alaska. This influence is comparable to the contribution associated with variations in atmospheric winds. Given the exceptional low-frequency character of the propagation of subsurface anomalies (e.g., multidecadal) along the gyre, monitoring subsurface temperature anomalies up stream along the North Pacific Current may enhance the decadal predictability of SST in the Gulf of Alaska and its impact on local marine ecosystems.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1488-1495,,5,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0333,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While grazers and viruses are typically studied independently, their impacts on microbial communities may be complicated by direct and indirect interactions of their mortality effects. Using a modification of the seawater dilution approach, we quantified growth and mortality rates for total phytoplankton and picophytoplankton populations (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes) at four contrasting sites in the California Current Ecosystem. Grazing mortality was significant in 10 of 15 cases, while viral effects were significant for 2 cases. Nonetheless, mortality estimates for the entire phytoplankton community based on chlorophyll a were 38 ± 13% higher when viral effects were included, relative to grazing alone. Mortality estimates for picophytoplankton varied in space and among groups. We also explored a potential methodological constraint of this method and hypothesize that heterotrophic bacteria may be affected by the dilution of their growth-sustaining substrates. For all picophytoplankton, estimates of grazing and viral mortality were inversely related within and across experiments. Indirect interactions among grazers and viruses may be important to consider if there are tradeoffs in the grazing and virus resistance strategies of prey/host cells.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1-17,,2,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0315,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; P0810; Process_cruise; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there still exist wide differences between satellite estimations and in situ measurements, as well as large discrepancies among results from different models. The reasons for these large differences are many, which include uncertainties in measurements, errors in satellitederived products, and limitations in the modeling approaches.

Equilibrium-based near-steady state models and the “wasp-waist” paradigm for eastern boundary currents predict tightly-coupled trophic interactions, with negative correlations between the abundance of planktivorous competitors and between dominant planktivores and their prey. Testing these hypotheses with the CalCOFI time series, we found them to be generally invalid. Potential competitors within the mesopelagic community (planktivorous verticalmigrators (VMs) and non-migrators (NMs)) were highly positively correlated, as were these groups with the mesopelagic piscivores (e.g. dragonfishes) that prey on them. In addition, the abundance of VMswasmostly positively correlated with that of epipelagic planktivores, such as anchovy, mackerels and hake. The VMs and epipelagic planktivores were negatively correlated with key potential planktonic prey groups, indicating a lack of bottom-up forcing. However, neither do these negative correlations appear to signify top-down forcing, since they seem to be mediated through correlations with key environmental drivers, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), sea surface temperature, and the relative strength of the California Current.We suggest that the web of correlations linking key meso- and epipelagic planktivores, their predators and prey ismediated through common links with basin-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the PDO and ENSO cycles. Thus, the abundance of mesopelagic fishes in the California Current is closely tied to variation in the oxygen minimumzone, whose dynamics have been linked to the PDO. The PDO and other drivers are also linked to the transport of the California Current System, which influences the abundance of many dominant taxa off southern California that have broad biogeographic distributions linked to water masses that extend to the north (Transition Zone/sub-Arctic faunas) or the south (tropical/subtropical faunas).",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,20-28,,,138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0246,,,,"CALCOFI; CCE; Calanoid copepod abundance (Ohman); Datazoo 153,155,166; Published; SWFSC icthyoplankton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A space-for-time exchange is one approach that permits use of natural spatial variability in the CCE to develop a mechanistic understanding needed to project future temporal changes.

M.",Feeding Preferences of Abyssal Macrofauna Inferred from In Situ Pulse Chase Experiments,PLoS ONE,,,,,"Climatic fluctuations may significantly alter the taxonomic and biochemical composition of phytoplankton blooms and subsequently phytodetritus, the food source for the majority of deep-sea communities. To examine the response of abyssal benthic communities to different food resources we simulated a food sedimentation event containing diatoms and coccolithophorids at Station M in the NE Pacific. In one set of experiments we measured incorporation of diatomC and coccoN into the macrofauna using isotopically enriched 13C-diatoms and 15N-coccolithophores. In a second experiment we measured incorporation of C and N from dual-labelled (13C and 15N) diatoms. The second experiment was repeated 2 months later to assess the effect of seasonality. The simulated food pulses represented additions of 650 – 800 mg C m22 and 120 mg N m22 to the seafloor. In all cases rapid incorporation of tracer was observed within 4 days, with between 20% and 52% of the macrofauna displaying evidence of enrichment. However, incorporation levels of both diatomC and coccoN were low (,0.05% and 0.005% of the added C and N). Incorporation of labelled diatoms was similar during both June and September suggesting that the community was not food limited during either period. We found no evidence for selective ingestion of the different food types in the metazoan fauna suggesting that macrofauna do not have strong preferences for diatom vs. coccolithophore dominated phytodetrital pulses. C:N ratios from both experiments suggest that the metazoan macrofauna community appear to have higher C demands and/or assimilation efficiencies compared to N. Concomitantly, the foraminifera preferentially selected for diatomN over coccoN, and we suggest that this may be related to foraminiferal requirements for intracellular nitrate. These experiments provide evidence that abyssal faunal feeding strategies are in part driven by an organism’s internal stoichiometric budgets and biochemical requirements.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,e80510,,11,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0351,,,,CCE; Published; Sta M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Climate change will alter the physico-chemical environment that reefs currently occupy, leaving only limited regions that are conducive to reef habitation. Identifying these regions early may aid conservation efforts and inform decisions to transplant particular coral species or groups. Here a species distribution model (Maxent) is used to describe habitat suitable for coral reef growth. Two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Earth System Model were used with Maxent to determine environmental suitability for corals (order Scleractinia). Environmental input variables best at representing the limits of suitable reef growth regions were isolated using a principal component analysis. Climate-driven changes in suitable habitat depend strongly on the unique region of reefs used to train Maxent. Increased global habitat loss was predicted in both climate projections through the 21<sup>st</sup> century. A maximum habitat loss of 43% by 2100 was predicted in RCP4.5 and 82% in RCP8.5. When the model is trained solely with environmental data from the Caribbean/Atlantic, 83% of global habitat was lost by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 88% was lost for RCP8.5. Similarly, global runs trained only with Pacific Ocean reefs estimated that 60% of suitable habitat would be lost by 2100 in RCP4.5 and 90% in RCP8.5. When Maxent was trained solely with Indian Ocean reefs, suitable habitat worldwide <italic>increased</italic> by 38% in RCP4.5 by 2100 and 28% in RCP8.5 by 2050. Global habitat loss by 2100 was just 10% for RCP8.5. This projection suggests that shallow tropical sites in the Indian Ocean basin experience conditions today that are most similar to future projections of worldwide conditions. Indian Ocean reefs may thus be ideal candidate regions from which to select the best strands of coral for potential re-seeding efforts. </p>",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,e82404,,12,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0297,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use field samples collected during a large natural environmental perturbation, the 1998–1999 alternation between El Nin˜o and La Nin˜a states, to test the ability of large dominant CCE zooplankton Euphausia pacifica and Calanus pacificus to alter their TPs in response to environmental variability. To distinguish trophic changes from variations of d15N values at the base of the food web, the zooplankton were assayed by Compound Specific Isotope Analysis of Amino Acids (CSIA-AA). Linear mixed-effect models were developed to utilize data from all amino acids (AAs), providing greater statistical power than the typical CSIA-AA approach of using only phenylalanine and glutamic acid. We confirm a significant 15N enrichment of , 2% at the base of the food web for all AAs and all zooplankton groups during the 1998 El Nin˜o. This baseline enrichment in 15N has been speculated to occur during El Nin˜o events but never conclusively shown.

An enhanced understanding of these fluctuations could improve fisheries management and predictions of fish's responses to climate change. We investigated dynamic height as a variable for identifying the spawning habitat of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). During cruises between 1998 and 2004, dynamic height was calculated from temperature and salinity profiles, while fish egg concentration was measured with obliquely towed bongo nets and the Continuous, Underway Fish Egg Sampler. Dynamic height ranged between 68 and 108cm, with values increasing offshore. The greatest probability of encountering anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel eggs occurred at dynamic heights of 79–83cm, 84–89cm, and 89–99cm, respectively. Four mechanisms were proposed to explain how dynamic height affects egg distribution: (1) dynamic height is a proxy for upper water column temperature and salinity, which are known to influence spawning habitat. (2) Low dynamic heights are indicative of coastal upwelling, which increases primary and secondary productivity. (3) Egg concentration is greater at dynamic heights coincident with geostrophic currents that transport larvae to favorable habitats. (4) Eddies delineated by dynamic height contours retain eggs in productive habitats. To evaluate these mechanisms, a generalized linear model was constructed using dynamic height, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, zooplankton volume, geostrophic currents, and eddies as independent variables. Dynamic height explained more variance than any other variable in models of sardine and anchovy spawning habitat. Together temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll accounted for 80–95% of the dynamic height effect, emphasizing the importance of the first two mechanisms. However, dynamic height remained statistically significant in the models of anchovy and jack mackerel spawning habitat after considering the effects of all other variables. Dynamic height shows promise as an ecological indicator of spawning habitat, because it integrates the effects of multiple oceanic variables, can be remotely sensed, and is predicted by ocean circulation models.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,79-91,,0,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0229,,,,CCE; CalCOFI; California Current; Datazoo 78; Dynamic height; Jack mackerel; Northern anchovy; Pacific sardine; Published; Sea surface height; Spawning habitat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solution methods have also called into question the biases of the commonly used L2 minimum norm (L2MN) solution technique. Here, we test the abilities of MCMC and L2MN methods to recover field-measured ecosystem rates that are sequentially excluded from the model input. For data, we use experimental measurements from process cruises of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE-LTER) Program that include rate estimates of phytoplankton and bacterial production, micro- and mesozooplankton grazing, and carbon export from eight study sites varying from rich coastal upwelling to offshore oligotrophic conditions. Both the MCMC and L2MN methods predicted well-constrained rates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing with reasonable accuracy, but the MCMC method overestimated primary production. The MCMC method more accurately predicted the poorly constrained rate of vertical carbon export than the L2MN method, which consistently overestimated export. Results involving DOC and bacterial production were equivocal. Overall, when primary production is provided as model input, the MCMC method gives a robust depiction of ecosystem processes. Uncertainty in inverse ecosystem models is large and arises primarily from solution under-determinacy. We thus suggest that experimental programs focusing on food web fluxes expand the range of experimental measurements to include the nature and fate of detrital pools, which play large roles in the model.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,20-33,,1,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0180,,,,CCE; California Current System; Ecosystem dynamics; Food web; Linear inverse model; Plankton; Published; Trophic structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sampled a frontal region (the A-Front) separating oligotrophic and mesotrophic water masses within the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) to assess the influence of frontal hydrography on several microbial parameters. Samples for heterotrophic bacterial, viral and flagellate abundance, dissolved and particulate carbon and nitrogen, transparent particles and bacterial carbon production were collected at 6 depths from the surface to 100 m with 5–9 conductivity/temperature/depth casts along a 26-km northerly transect across the front. Relative to adjacent oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters, the frontal transition displayed peaks in the mean estimates of cell-specific bacterial carbon and bulk bacterial production, particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen concentrations, and the abundance and size of transparent particles. Bacterial carbon production increased  5-fold northward from oligotrophic waters to the frontal zone, in agreement with an increase in the frequency of dividing cells, but bacterial abundance was lower than at adjacent stations. This may be partially explained by high chlorophyll, elevated virus:bacteria ratios and low nanoflagellate grazer abundance at the front.

However, their impacts on the fate of biogenic organic carbon in coastal oceans are not well quantified because physical and biological interactions at such features are very complex with short time- and small spatial scales variability. As part of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) Process studies in the southern California Current in October 2008, we sampled across a strong temperature and chlorophyll front (‘A-Front’) separating water masses with distinct hydrographic and biogeochemical characteristics and a modified biological assemblage at the frontal interface. Thorpe-scale analyses of the hydrographic data from a free-fall moving vessel profiler suggested an increased diapycnal diffusive nitrate flux at the front zone. Based on these field data, we use data-driven diagnostic biogeochemical models to quantify how the front-induced physical mixing influenced the production, grazing and transport of phytoplankton carbon in the southern California Current.

Using community-level growth and grazing data from dilution experiments, generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed to describe the effects of temperature and chlorophyll on m : μ. At low chlorophyll levels, m : μ decreases with increasing temperature, whereas at high chlorophyll levels, m : μ increases initially with temperature before reaching a peak and then declines. These complex responses of m : μ result from mixed effects of temperature and chlorophyll on microzooplankton biomass (Bz), biomass-specific microzooplankton grazing rate (m : Bz), and phytoplankton growth rate (μ). Bz decreases with rising temperature and increases with rising chlorophyll. m : Bz increases with temperature and decreases with chlorophyll. Nutrient-enriched growth rate of phytoplankton (μn) and μ increase with increasing temperature and chlorophyll. Holding chlorophyll constant, the calculated activation energies of m : Bz and μn are 0.67 ± 0.05 and 0.36 ± 0.05 eV, respectively, both consistent with previous MTE estimates for heterotrophs and autotrophs. Our study indicates that warming may enhance phytoplankton losses to microzooplankton herbivory in eutrophic but not in oligotrophic waters. The GAM analysis also provides important insights into underlying system relationships and reasons why community-level responses in natural systems may depart from theory based on laboratory data and individual species.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,519-526,,2,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0205,,,,CCE; Climate change; P0605; P0704; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found increased biomass and productivity when the NPC was shifted poleward, and suggest that positioning influences advective transport of nutrients and perhaps key planktonic organisms from the sub-arctic domain thereby enhancing mid to upper trophic level species. This study is significant because climate change is predicted to cause poleward shifts in the westerlies that drive ocean currents and positioning of large marine gyre systems.

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>, reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO<sub>2</sub>. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with <italic>a priori</italic> expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.</p>",2011,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,e28983,,12,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0201,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altimetry since 1993 indicates that global MSL rise has increased about 50% above the 20th century rise rate, from 2 to 3 mm yr&#8722;1. At the same time, both tide gauge measurements and altimetry indicate virtually no increase along the Pacific coast of North America during the satellite epoch. Here we show that the dynamical steric response of North Pacific eastern boundary ocean circulation to a dramatic change in wind stress curl, &#964;xy, which occurred after the mid-1970s regime shift, can account for the suppression of regional sea level rise along this coast since 1980. Alarmingly, mean &#964;xy over the North Pacific recently reached levels not observed since before the mid-1970s regime shift. This change in wind stress patterns may be foreshadowing a Pacific Decadal Oscillation regime shift, causing an associated persistent change in basin-scale &#964;xy that may result in a concomitant resumption of sea level rise along the U.S. West Coast to global or even higher rates.",2011,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,C07005,,C7,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0185,,,,"1620 Global Change: Climate dynamics (0429, 3309); 1637 Global Change: Regional climate change (4321); 3309 Atmospheric Processes: Climatology (1616, 1620, 3305, 4215, 8408); 4513 Oceanography: Physical: Decadal ocean variability (1616, 1635, 3305, 4215); 4556 Oceanography: Physical: Sea level: variations and mean (1222, 1225, 1641); CCE; Published; dynamical response; regional sea level rise; satellite altimetry; thermocline; tide gauge; wind stress curl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The correlation between Chl-a and wind speed is generally negative in areas with deep mixed layers and positive in areas with shallow mixed layers. These patterns are interpreted in terms of the main limiting factors that control phytoplankton growth, i.e., either nutrients that control phytoplankton biomass in areas with positive correlation between Chl-a and wind speed or light that controls phytoplankton biomass in areas with negative correlation between Chl-a and wind speed. More complex patterns are observed in the equatorial regions due to regional specificities in physical-biological interactions.

They are also genetically diverse with at least 10 described clades and physiologically diverse capable of motility, using different sources of nitrogen or phosphorus, or modifying the composition of their photosynthetic pigments, for example. As more is learned of their diversity, however, it has become less clear how their genetic diversity reflects their physiological diversity and the ecological niches that they occupy. By developing novel, culture-independent methods, biogeographic patterns were uncovered to provide a framework to link the genetic, physiological, and ecological diversity of marine Synechococcus. Quantitative PCR was used to show that the coastal Southern California Bight is dominated by two Synechococcus clades. Relative to each other, the abundance of these clades varied seasonally indicating that they occupied distinct ecological niches. Synechococcus biogeography was explored further using a novel high-throughput hybridization method (Luminex) to examine the distribution of sub-clades within the two co-existing clades. Even at this scale of diversity, ecological differentiation was apparent. Most interestingly, in mesotrophic environments of the Southern California Bight a sub-clade was abundant in deep water (50 m) while most other sub-clades preferred surface waters. Environmental metagenomic sequences were used to investigate the role of selection in shaping the diversity of Synechococcus populations. The large majority of genes have evolved under purifying selection. Genes that were well represented in environmental populations and may be essential for the population in the coastal Southern California Bight tended to be more evolutionarily conserved. Genes that may have been positively selected were mostly hypothetical genes and were more rare in the environment. For this dissertation, the diversity, biogeography, and evolution of Synechococcus were examined at a level of detail not previously available. The results of this research formed a foundation for further investigations into the genetic and environmental factors regulating the ecological functions and niches of Synechococcus populations. More generally, this research addressed the scales at which bacterial evolution and diversification occur, and how bacterial populations are adapted to their environment.",2009,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, San Diego",San Diego,,,Ph.D.,,,,,0162,,,,"CCE Dissertations, Academic UCSD Marine biology; PhD_thesis; Published",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SYFYHQEE,journalArticle,2019,"Ellen, J. S.",Improving plankton image classification using context metadata,Limnology and Oceanography - Methods,,,,,"Advances in both hardware and software are enabling rapid proliferation of in situ plankton imaging methods, requiring more effective machine learning approaches to image classification. Deep Learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), show marked improvement over traditional feature-based supervised machine learning algorithms, but require careful optimization of hyperparameters and adequate training sets. Here, we document some best practices in applying CNNs to zooplankton and marine snow images and note where our results differ from contemporary Deep Learning findings in other domains. We boost the performance of CNN classifiers by incorporating metadata of different types and illustrate how to assimilate metadata beyond simple concatenation. We utilize both geotemporal (e.g., sample depth, location, time of day) and hydrographic (e.g., temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a) metadata and show that either type by itself, or both combined, can substantially reduce error rates. Incorporation of context metadata also boosts performance of the feature-based classifiers we evaluated: Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, Gradient Boosted Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Multilayer Perceptron. For our assessments, we use an original data set of 350,000 in situ images (roughly 50% marine snow and 50% nonsnow sorted into 26 categories) from a novel in situ Zooglider. We document asymptotically increasing performance with more computationally intensive techniques, such as substantially deeper networks and artificially augmented data sets. Our best model achieves 92.3% accuracy with our 27-class data set. We provide guidance for further refinements that are likely to provide additional gains in classifier accuracy.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,439-461,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0456,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oceanogr.,,,,,"Advances in in situ imaging allow enumeration of abundant populations of large Rhizarians that compose a substantial proportion of total mesozooplankton biovolume. Using a quasi‐Lagrangian sampling scheme, we quantified the abundance, vertical distributions, and sinking‐related mortality of Aulosphaeridae, an abundant family of Phaeodaria in the California Current Ecosystem. Inter‐cruise variability was high, with average concentrations at the depth of maximum abundance ranging from < 10 to > 300 cells m−3, with seasonal and interannual variability associated with temperature‐preferences and regional shoaling of the 10°C isotherm. Vertical profiles showed that these organisms were consistently most abundant at 100–150 m depth. Average turnover times with respect to sinking were 4.7–10.9 d, equating to minimum in situ population growth rates of ~ 0.1–0.2 d−1. Using simultaneous measurements of sinking organic carbon, we find that these organisms could only meet their carbon demand if their carbon : volume ratio were ~ 1 μg C mm−3. This value is substantially lower than previously used in global estimates of rhizarian biomass, but is reasonable for organisms that use large siliceous tests to inflate their cross‐sectional area without a concomitant increase in biomass. We found that Aulosphaeridae alone can intercept > 20% of sinking particles produced in the euphotic zone before these particles reach a depth of 300 m. Our results suggest that the local (and likely global) carbon biomass of Aulosphaeridae, and probably the large Rhizaria overall, needs to be revised downwards, but that these organisms nevertheless play a major role in carbon flux attenuation in the twilight zone.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,2579-2594,,6,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0407,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined cross-frontal changes in mesopelagic fish assemblages at three separate frontal systems in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) as part of the CCE Long Term Ecological Research program: the A-Front sampled in October 2008, the C-Front in June/July 2011, and the EFront in July/August 2012. We analyzed the differential effects of front-associated regions on density and species composition of adult migratory and non-migratory fishes and larvae, and the larval to adult ratio (as a possible index of a population growth potential) for migratory and non-migratory species. The fronts did not have a strong effect on densities of any subset of the mesopelagic fish assemblage. The species composition of the vertical migratory fishes (and their larvae) was typically altered across fronts, with different assemblages present on either side of each front. The migratory assemblages at the fronts themselves were indistinguishable from those at the more productive side of the frontal system. In contrast, the assemblage composition of the nonmigratory fishes was indistinguishable between regions across all three of the fronts. The differences between the Northern and Southern assemblages at the A-Front were primarily based on biogeographic provinces, while the assemblages at the E-Front were largely distinguishable by their oceanic or coastal-upwelling zone associations. These results generally confirm those of previous studies on frontal systems in the California Current Ecosystem and elsewhere. The ratio of larvae to adults, a potential index of population growth potential, was altered across two of the fronts for migratory species, elevated on the colder side of the A-Front and the warmer side of the EFront. This finding suggests that fronts may be regions of enhanced reproduction. The larvae to adult ratio was indistinguishable for non-migratory species at all three frontal systems. The non-migratory component of the community was little influenced by the presence of a front, apparently because the regions of strongest horizontal spatial gradients were too shallow to be experienced directly. We speculate that there was no change in larval community composition and population growth index at the most dynamic frontal system (C-Front) compared to the other fronts surveyed because the frontal feature was short-lived relative to the time scale for population growth of the fish. However, the difference in results of the C-Front may also be due to a change in methodology used in this study. If mesoscale features such as fronts increase in frequency off the California coast in the future as predicted, they have the potential to alter population growth potential and restructure mesopelagic fish assemblages, which are dominated by migratory species.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,80-91,,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0422,,,,CCE; P0810; P1106; P1208; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, PDV is also strongly tied to teleconnection dynamics interacting with the tropics, primarily the interactions between meridional modes in the extra-tropics and ENSO, and between the ENSO teleconnections and the dominant modes of atmospheric variability in the mid-latitude.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,128-144,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0392,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea surface temperature (SST) observations show that the variance of the El Niño-like decadal variability has increased by 30% (1920-2015) with a stronger coupling between the major Pacific climate modes. Although we cannot attribute these trends to global climate change, the examination of 30 members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (LENS) forced with the RCP8.5 radiative forcing scenario (1920-2100) suggests that significant anthropogenic trends in Pacific decadal variance will emerge by 2020 in response to a more energetic North Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM)—a well-known El Niño precursor. The PMM is a key mechanism for energizing and coupling tropical and extratropical decadal variability.

Ichthyoplankton surveys provide one approach to such monitoring. We conducted weekly fish egg collections off the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Pier (La Jolla, CA, USA) for 3 yr (2014 to 2017) and added a second sampling site near the La Jolla kelp forest for 1 yr (2017). Fish eggs were identified using DNA barcoding and data were compared to previous work from SIO Pier surveys from 2012 to 2014. We documented large interannual variability in fish egg abundance associated with climatic fluctuations, including an El Niño event captured during our sampling years. Overall egg abundance was reduced by >50% during periods of anomalously warm water in 2014 to 2016. Fish egg abundance rebounded in 2017 and was accompanied by a phenological shift of peak spawning activity. We found that interannual fish egg abundance may be linked with upwelling regimes and winter temperatures. Across the period of joint sampling, we found no distinct differences in community composition between the SIO Pier (soft bottom) and kelp forest habitat we sampled (2 km distant). Long-term monitoring of fish spawning can contribute to our understanding of how natural environmental variation, such as El Niño events, affects fish reproductive activity.

The threat of domoic acid (DA) toxicity to human and wildlife health is the dominant harmful algal bloom (HAB) concern for the region, leading to a strong focus on prediction and mitigation of these blooms and their toxic effects. This paper describes the initial development of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping (C-HARM) system that predicts the spatial likelihood of blooms and dangerous levels of DA using a unique blend of numerical models, ecological forecast models of the target group, Pseudo-nitzschia, and satellite ocean color imagery. Data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) are applied to ocean color imagery to fill in missing data and then used in a multivariate mode with other modeled variables to forecast biogeochemical parameters. Daily predictions (nowcast and forecast maps) are run routinely at the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and posted on its public website. Skill assessment of model output for the nowcast data is restricted to nearshore pixels that overlap with routine pier monitoring of HABs in California from 2014 to 2015. Model lead times are best correlated with DA measured with solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) and marine mammal strandings from DA toxicosis, suggesting long-term benefits of the HAB predictions to decisionmaking.

We show that size-dependent changes in trawl capture efficiency can affect acoustic estimates of biomass estimates 5-fold. We used both acoustic and trawl-based methods (informed by morphological data and acoustic modeling of individual backscattering) to estimate the biomass of mesopelagic fishes of southern California to be 25–37 g m−2 of ocean surface, a comparable density to that of inshore epipelagic zooplanktivorous fishes.

A range of dFe-binding ligand classes was simultaneously determined using multiple analytical window analysis, involving titrations with multiple concentrations of the added ligand, salicylaldoxime. The highest dFe and ligand concentrations were determined in the low salinity end of the estuary, with dFe equal to 131.5nmolL−1 and strong ligand (log KFeL,Fe′cond≥12.0) concentrations equal to 139.5nmolL−1. The weakest ligands (log KFeL,Fe′cond11.0) were tightly coupled to dFe throughout the estuary, with average excess ligand concentrations ([L]–[dFe]) equal to 0.5nmolL−1. Humic-like substances analyzed via both CLE-ACSV and proton nuclear magnetic resonance in several samples were found to be a significant portion of the dFe-binding ligand pool in San Francisco Bay, with concentrations ranging from 559.5μgL−1 to 67.5μgL−1 in the lowest and highest salinity samples, respectively. DFe-binding ligands and humic-like substances were also found in benthic boundary layer samples taken from the shelf near the mouths of San Francisco Bay and Eel River, suggesting estuaries are an important source of dFe-binding ligands to California coastal shelf waters.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,183-194,,,173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0331,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small, variable salinity pond in the San Elijo Lagoon estuary in southern California was chosen to serve as a model pond due to its routinely high chlorophyll content. Profiles of microalgal assemblages from water samples collected from April 2011 to January 2012 were obtained by constructing 18S rDNA environmental clone libraries. Pond assemblages were found to be dominated by green algae Picochlorum sp. and Picocystis sp. throughout the year. Pigment analysis suggested that the two species contributed most of the chlorophyll a of the pond, which ranged from 21.9 to 664.3 μg · L−1 with the Picocystis contribution increasing at higher salinities. However, changes of temperature, salinity or irradiance may have enabled a bloom of the diatom Chaetoceros sp. in June 2011. Isolates of these microalgae were obtained and their growth rates characterized as a function of temperature and salinity. Chaetoceros sp. had the highest growth rate over the temperature test range while it showed the most sensitivity to high salinity.

J.","Multivariate ocean-climate indicators (MOCI) for the central California Current: environmental  change, 1990-2010.",Progress in Oceanography,,,,,"Temporal environmental variability may confound interpretations of management actions, such as reduced fisheries mortality when Marine Protected Areas are implemented. To aid in the evaluation of recent ecosystem protection decisions in central-northern California, we designed and implemented multivariate ocean-climate indicators (MOCI) of environmental variability. To assess the validity of the MOCI, we evaluated interannual and longer-term variability in relation to previously recognized environmental variability in the region, and correlated MOCI to a suite of biological indicators including proxies for lower- (phytoplankton, copepods, krill), and upper-level (seabirds) taxa. To develop the MOCI, we selected, compiled, and synthesized 14 well-known atmospheric and oceanographic indicators of large-scale and regional processes (transport and upwelling), as well as local atmospheric and oceanic response variables such as wind stress, sea surface temperature, and salinity. We derived seasonallystratified MOCI using principal component analysis. Over the 21-year study period (1990–2010), the ENSO cycle weakened while extra-tropical influences increased with a strengthening of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and cooling of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Correspondingly, the Northern Oscillation Index (NOI) strengthened, leading to enhanced upwelling-favorable wind stress and cooling of air and ocean surface temperatures. The seasonal MOCI related well to subarctic copepod biomass and seabird productivity, but poorly to chlorophyll-a concentration and krill abundance. Our results support a hypothesis of enhanced sub-arctic influence (transport from the north) and upwelling intensification in north-central California over the past two decades. Such environmental conditions may favor population growth for species with sub-arctic zoogeographic affinities within the central-northern California Current coastal ecosystem.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,352-369,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0250,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CALCOFI; P0605; P0704; P0810; P1106; P1208; Process_cruise; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J52I4DD3,journalArticle,2014,"Ruhl, H. A.",Links between deep-sea respiration and community dynamics,Ecology,,,,,"It has been challenging to establish the mechanisms that link ecosystem functioning to environmental and resource variation, as well as community structure, composition, and compensatory dynamics. A compelling hypothesis of compensatory dynamics, known as ‘‘zero-sum’’ dynamics, is framed in terms of energy resource and demand units, where there is an inverse link between the number of individuals in a community and the mean individual metabolic rate. However, body size energy distributions that are nonuniform suggest a niche advantage at a particular size class, which suggests a limit to which metabolism can explain community structuring. Since 1989, the composition and structure of abyssal seafloor communities in the northeast Pacific and northeast Atlantic have varied interannually with links to climate and resource variation. Here, for the first time, class and mass-specific individual respiration rates were examined along with resource supply and time series of density and biomass data of the dominant abyssal megafauna, echinoderms. Both sites had inverse relationships between density and mean individual metabolic rate. We found fourfold variation in echinoderm respiration over interannual timescales at both sites, which were linked to shifts in species composition and structure. In the northeastern Pacific, the respiration of mobile surface deposit feeding echinoderms was positively linked to climatedriven particulate organic carbon fluxes with a temporal lag of about one year, respiring ;1– 6% of the annual particulate organic carbon flux.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1651-1662,,6,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0350,,,,CCE; Published; Sta M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4E7SPWXP,journalArticle,2014,"Goebel, N. L.","Modeled diversity effects on microbial ecosystem functions of primary production, nutrient uptake, and remineralization",Ecology,,,,,"Ecosystem-wide primary productivity generally increases with primary producer diversity, emphasizing the importance of diversity for ecosystem function. However, most studies that demonstrate this positive relationship have focused on terrestrial and aquatic benthic systems, with little attention to the diverse marine pelagic primary producers that play an important role in regulating global climate. Here we show how phytoplankton biodiversity enhances overall marine ecosystem primary productivity and other ecosystem functions using a self-organizing ecosystem model. Diversity manipulation numerical experiments reveal positive, asymptotically saturating relationships between ecosystem-wide phytoplankton diversity and functions of productivity, nutrient uptake, remineralization, and diversity metrics used to identify mechanisms shaping these relationships. Increase in productivity with increasing diversity improves modeled ecosystem stability and model robustness and leads to productivity rates that exceed expected yields primarily through niche complementarity and facilitative interactions between coexisting phytoplankton types; the composition of traits in assemblages determines the magnitude of complementarity and selection effects. While findings based on these aggregate measures of diversity effects parallel those from the majority of experimental outcomes of terrestrial and benthic biodiversity–ecosystem function studies, we combine analyses of community diversity effects and investigations of the underlying interactions among phytoplankton types to demonstrate how an increase in recycled production of non-diatoms through an increase in new production of diatoms drives this diversity–ecosystem function response. We demonstrate the important role that facilitation plays in the modeled marine plankton and how this facilitative interaction could amplify future climate-driven changes in ocean ecosystem productivity.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,153-163,,1,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0294,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that recent high variability in demographic attributes of salmon and seabirds off California is related to increasing variability in remote, large-scale forcing in the North Pacific operating through changes in local food webs. Linear, indirect numerical responses between krill (primarily Thysanoessa spinifera) and juvenile rockfish abundance (catch per unit effort (CPUE)) explained >80% of the recent variability in the demography of these pelagic predators. We found no relationships between krill and regional upwelling, though a strong connection to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index was established. Variance in NPGO and related central Pacific warming index increased after 1985, whereas variance in the canonical ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation did not change. Anthropogenic global warming or natural climate variability may explain recent intensification of the NPGO and its increasing ecological significance. Assessing non-stationarity in atmospheric-environmental interactions and placing greater emphasis on documenting changes in variance of bio-physical systems will enable insight into complex climate-marine ecosystem dynamics.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1662 - 1675,,6,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0224,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because such measurements are not routinely available, we developed predictive models of water-column (0–200 m) nitrate based on temperature for a region of the California Current System (30–47 N) within 50 km from the coast. Prediction was done using generalized additive models based on a compilation of 37,607 observations collected over the period 1959–2004 and validated with a separate set of 6430 observations for the period 2005–2011. A temperature-only model had relatively high explanatory power (explained deviance, D2¼71.6%) but contained important depth, latitudinal, and seasonal biases. A model incorporating salinity in addition to temperature (D2¼91.2%) corrected for the latitudinal and depth biases but not the seasonal bias. The best model included oxygen, temperature, and salinity (D2¼96.6%) and adequately predicted nitrate temporal behavior at two widely separated locations (44 39.10N and 32 54.60N) with slight or no bias [root-mean-square error (RMSE)¼2.39 and 0.40 mM, respectively). For situations when only temperature is available, a model including depth, month, and latitude as proxy covariates corrects some of the biases, but it had lower predictive skill (RMSE¼2.50 and 5.22 lM, respectively). The results of this study have applications for the proxy derivation of nitrate availability for primary producers (phytoplankton, macroalgae) in upwelling regions and for biogeochemical and ecosystem modeling studies.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1-17,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0231,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spatially and temporally resolved CalCOFI sampling program has documented decadal changes in marine populations in a way that is unprecedented in the ocean. Though the fluctuations in chemical and biological properties were clear in the data, the dynamics underlying these variations were often not apparent. These long-term fluctuations are often a result of complex interactions between the atmospheric forcing, the ocean's physical response, and the integrative effects of the biological dynamics. It is difficult to move beyond simple correlations in analyzing these diverse data sets in the absence of a dynamical framework.  Coupled physical-chemical-biological models are excellent platforms for both synthesizing diverse data sets, and gaining understanding of the interactions among complex, nonlinear processes. Advances in computing power have enabled us to perform global-scale simulations with high regional-scale resolution. Combining such models with the long-term data set offered by programs such as CalCOFI and CCE-LTER gives us the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the atmospheric and oceanic forcings that result in the observed biological fluctuations. Here we describe some of the novel insights we have gained by using models to explore the physical-biological couplings underlying the interannual and decadal fluctuations observed in the CCS. We begin by describing the oceanic response to atmospheric forcing at basin scales, and the description of two dominant modes of atmosphere-ocean coupling: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Because the NPGO drives much of the low-frequency variability of nutrients in the CCS, we then explore the influence of the NPGO on planktonic ecosystems in the CCS at regional scales, and show how physical-biological interactions determine planktonic community structure. Finally we link these long-term changes in physical forcing to the intense biological dynamics found at frontal systems in the CCS.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,26-33,,3,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0233,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our analyses focused on two species of particle-grazing copepods (Calanus pacificus and Eucalanus californicus) and two species of carnivorous chaetognaths (Sagitta bierii and Sagitta euneritica), drawing on the CalCOFI zooplankton time series from both the southern and central sectors of the California Current System. We detected a significant difference between regions in average stable N isotope content of the two species of copepods, with δ15N elevated by 0.5–1.1 per mil in the southern region, but no regional differences in the isotopic content of the chaetognaths. We address climate influences over a 54-year time period, on three different time scales: interannual (dominated by ENSO), decadal, and multi-decadal. Three of four species showed evidence of an ENSO-related isotopic shift toward increased 15N during El Niño conditions. In addition, in Southern California waters, C. pacificus and S. euneritica showed elevated δ15N in the warm phase of the NE Pacific between 1978 and 1998 relative to the preceding and following time periods. When considered over the entire 5½ decades treated here, for most species there was remarkable long-term stability in stable isotope content in both southern and central California waters, despite interannual and decadal perturbations. Only E. californicus in the southern sector showed a significant downward secular trend in δ15N. Variability of δ15N in 3 species covaried with the average nitrate concentration in the mixed layer, suggesting altered nitrate utilization at the base of the food web as a primary mechanism underlying interannual changes in zooplankton isotopic content.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,46-55,,0,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0196,,,,CCE; California Current System; Chaetognaths; Climate change; Copepods; El Niño; Published; Stable N isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We characterized the A-Front with two novel devices, a free-fall Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) and an Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5), together with quantitative bongo samples analyzed by ZooScan. The MVP permitted real-time visualization of vertical density structure, chlorophyll a fluorescence and particle size structure (from a laser optical particle counter) across the front to a depth of 200 m with the research vessel moving at 6 m s21. The UVP5 quantified in situ vertical distributions from digital images of planktonic organisms and particles in profiles to 300 m. Both the MVP and UVP5 indicated that organic aggregates increased several-fold at the A-Front. The A-Front was a region of elevated abundance of mainly particle-grazing mesozooplankton, including calanoid copepods, Oithona spp., appendicularians and euphausiids, as well as a site of elevated ratio of nauplii copepod21. In contrast, poecilostomatoid copepods, ostracods, chaetognaths and radiolaria, most of which are more carnivorous or omnivorous, were all elevated in abundance to the south of the front.

They are known to interact with biota on the individual level, e.g. through ingestion, but their population-level impacts are largely unknown. One potential mechanism for microplastic-induced alteration of pelagic ecosystems is through the introduction of hard-substrate habitat to ecosystems where it is naturally rare. Here, we show that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades, and that this increase has released the pelagic insect Halobates sericeus from substrate limitation for oviposition. High concentrations of microplastic in the NPSG resulted in a positive correlation between H. sericeus and microplastic, and an overall increase in H. sericeus egg densities. Predation on H. sericeus eggs and recent hatchlings may facilitate the transfer of energy between pelagic- and substrate-associated assemblages. The dynamics of hard-substrate-associated organisms may be important to understanding the ecological impacts of oceanic microplastic pollution.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,817-820,,5,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0206,,,,CCE; Published; Supplement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three distinct autotrophic assemblages were identified. Fluorescence was found to be three to four times higher in cooler mesotrophic waters north of the front than in warm oligotrophic waters to the south. Northern waters were distinguished by a shallow pigment maximum dominated by a blue-water type of Synechococcus and by the presence of green-water Synechococcus and cryptophytes; only blue-water Synechococcus were detected at lower concentration south of the front. The highest Cchl and AC values, accompanied by elevated Fv/Fm and chlorophyll fluorescence per unit of Cchl, and minimal Synechococcus abundance, were found directly at the front in a 20–40 m deep layer dominated by diatoms. The covariation of Fv/Fm with nitrate concentration in this layer, along with the structural changes in the phytoplankton community, suggest that it had been generated by in situ processes rather than advection. Strong structural responses to the local hydrography were also revealed by high-frequency underway ALF surface sampling, which detected an abrupt transition from low to high SYN on the northern side of a sharp salinity gradient at the front. Synechococcus-specific phycoerythrin fluorescence (FPE12) and SYN were highly correlated in surface waters (R2= 0.95), while FPE12:SYN gradually increased with depth.

G.",Modeling phytoplankton growth rates and chlorophyll to carbon ratios in California coastal and pelagic ecosystems,Journal of Geophysical Research,,,,<Go to ISI>://000282768500001,"To understand and quantify plankton community dynamics in the ocean, high-resolution models are needed to capture the temporal and spatial variations of physical, biological, and biogeochemical processes. However, ecosystem models often fail to agree with observations. This failure can be due to inadequacies in the data and/or inadequacies in the model formulation and parameterization. Here we parameterize and optimize a two-phytoplankton functional type model of phytoplankton growth rate and chlorophyll/ carbon (Chl:C) ratio using data from the Lagrangian field measurements conducted during process cruises of the Long-Term Ecosystem Research-California Current Ecosystem (CCE) program. We parameterize the model based on a small coastal subset of the data and then extend and test it with the full data set, including data from offshore regions. The CCE process studies were focused on quantifying the size-resolved planktonic growth, grazing, production, and export rates while following water parcels. The resulting data therefore provided strong constraints for the model we employed. The modeled growth rates and Chl: C ratios were in good agreement with observations. Our results indicate that the model can accurately predict Chl: C ratios, biomasses, and growth rates of dominant functional types using relatively easily measured environmental variables (temperature, nutrients, and bulk chlorophyll). The model also accurately reproduces the subsurface maxima of growth rates, the spatial separation of carbon and chlorophyll maxima, and many other observations in the California Current coastal and pelagic ecosystems.",2010-10,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,G04003,,,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0105,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studying infrastructure development empirically not only in terms of spatial issues but also, and equally importantly, temporal ones, we illustrate how the long-term matters. Our case is about the collaborative development of a metadata standard for an ecological research domain. It is a complex example where standards are recognized as one element of infrastructure and standard-making efforts include integration of semantic work and software tools development. With a focus on the temporal scales of short-term and long-term, we analyze the practices and views of the main parties involved in the development of the standard. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) extension of the notion of infrastructure to more explicitly include the temporal dimension; 2) identification of two distinct temporal orientations in information infrastructure development work, namely 'project time' and 'infrastructure time', and 3) association of related development orientations, particularly 'continuing design' as a development orientation that recognizes 'infrastructure time'. We conclude by highlighting the need to enrich understandings of temporality in CSCW, particularly towards longer time scales and more diversified temporal hybrids in collaborative infrastructure development. This work draws attention to the manifold ramifications that 'infrastructure time', as an example of more extended temporal scales, suggests for CSCW and e-Research infrastructures.",2010-08,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,377-415,,3-4,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0163,,,,CCE LTER; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assess interannual variability in springtime abundances of zooplankton sampled in the epipelagic layer, using CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) zooplankton samples from two regions: Southern California (SC) and Central California (CC). Thecosome pteropods show no evidence of recent declines in abundance in SC or CC waters. In SC, sampling was sufficient to conclude that heteropods and large foraminifera also show no evidence of declines in abundance in recent years. These results do not preclude asyet undetected changes in vertical distributions or shell morphology, and underscore the importance of sustained in situ measurement programs in order to detect and understand changes to pelagic ecosystems.

The model is a simple linear function of net primary productivity (NPP): Export = 0.08 × NPP + 72 where EF is export flux in mg C m−2 d−1 . We confirm that contrary to several global algorithms export efficiency (e-ratio = export/primary productivity) is negatively correlated with net primary productivity. We find that linear models with a steeper slope of EF relative to NPP produce better estimates of the variability range. Choice of the EF model parameterization can more than double the estimate of temporal variability (standard deviation) in satellite-derived EF time series. The best estimates of EF were obtained when using average NPP during a preceding period of ~7–8 days. This is in contrast with NPP where the best satellite estimates of in situ NPP were obtained using same day satellite data and the coefficient of determination was monotonically decreasing with increasing time lag. We also find that there is substantial unexplained variability in EF that cannot be explained by existing models.",2020,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0443,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidatethe food web pathways supporting the trophic structure and carbon export in this unique ecosystem, weused Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to assimilate data from four independent realizations ofδ15N andplanktonic rate measurements from the CRD into steady state, multicompartment ecosystem box models(linear inverse models). Model results present well-constrained snapshots of ecosystem nitrogen and stableisotopefluxes. New production is supported by upwelled nitrate, not nitrogenfixation. Protistivory (ratherthan herbivory) was the most important feeding mode for mesozooplankton, which rely heavily onmicrozooplankton prey. Mesozooplankton play a central role in vertical nitrogen export, primarily throughactive transport of nitrogen consumed in the surface layer and excreted at depth, which comprised anaverage 36–46% of total export. Detritus or aggregate feeding is also an important mode of resourceacquisition by mesozooplankton and regeneration of nutrients within the euphotic zone. As a consequence,the ratio of passively sinking particle export to phytoplankton production is very low in the CRD. Comparisonsto similar models constrained with data from the nearby equatorial Pacific demonstrate that the dominant roleof vertical migrators to the biological pump is a unique feature of the CRD. However, both regions showefficient nitrogen transfer from mesozooplankton to higher trophic levels (as expected for regions with largefish, cetacean, and seabird populations) despite the dominance of protists as major grazers of phytoplankton.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1815-1832,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0438,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have reported on the temporal and spatial variability of primary production and gravitational export in the CCE. However, few studies have quantified the partitioning of net primary and new production into other reservoirs of detrital organic matter. This study tested the hypothesis that nonsinking detrital reservoirs are an exportable reservoir of new production in the CCE with samples collected by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation survey between 2008 and 2010. Water column gradients in nitrate (NO3) and total organic carbon (TOC; which excludes sinking particulate organic carbon) were used to estimate potential rates of new production (PNew) and TOC production (PTOC), respectively. The PTOC:PNew varied between 0.16 and 0.56 and often increased with indicators of enhanced autotrophic production. At times, surface stratification was also correlated with elevated PTOC:PNew. In the most productive, inshore region, PTOC exceeded previously reported sinking export rates, which identified TOC as a quantitatively significant repository of exportable carbon in the CCE. However the sum of PTOC and sinking export for these productive regions was less than both PNew and oxygen-based estimates of net community production. These results imply that nonsinking reservoirs alone are not sufficient to explain observed imbalances between production and export for the most productive CCE regions.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0424,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two independent, yet complementary timeseries, CalCOFI ichthyoplankton surveys and sampling of southern California powerplant cooling-water intakes, have indicated that an assemblage of predominantlycool-water affinity fishes spanning nearshore to oceanic environments in the south-ern CCS has declined dramatically from the 1970s to the 2000s. We examinedpotential oceanographic drivers behind this decline both within and north of theCalCOFI survey area in order to capture upstream processes as well. Empiricalorthogonal function (EOF) analyses using output from a data-assimilative regionalocean model revealed significant relationships between the fish time series and spa-tial patterns of upwelling, upper ocean heat content and eddy kinetic energy in theCCS. Correlation and linear regression analyses indicated that the declining trend infish abundance was correlated with a suite of factors: reduced offshore andincreased inshore upwelling; a long term warming trend combined with more recentinterannual variability in ocean temperature; weaker eddy kinetic energy north ofPoint Conception (35°N), potentially indicating reduced transport of the CaliforniaCurrent (CC); increased influence of the California Undercurrent (CUC); and adecline in zooplankton displacement volume across the southern CCS.

These layers of heightened chlorophyll and/or phytoplankton concentrations are generally thought to be a consequence of a balance between light energy from above and a limiting nutrient flux from below, typically nitrate (NO3). Here we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that iron (Fe) limits or with light colimits phytoplankton communities in SCMLs along a primary productivity gradient from coastal to oligotrophic offshore waters in the southern California Current ecosystem. SCML phytoplankton responded markedly to added Fe or Fe/light in experimental incubations and transcripts of diatom and picoeukaryote Fe stress genes were strikingly abundant in SCML metatranscriptomes. Using a biogeochemical proxy with data from a 40-y time series, we find that diatoms growing in California Current SCMLs are persistently Fe deficient during the spring and summer growing season.We also find that the spatial extent of Fe deficiency within California Current SCMLs has significantly increased over the last 25 y in line with a regional climate index. Finally, we show that diatom Fe deficiency may be common in the subsurface of major upwelling zones worldwide.

Maintaining predator–prey relationships through protection of pelagic hotspots is crucial for conservation and manage-ment of living marine resources. Biotic components of pelagic, plankton- based, ecosystems exhibit high variability in abundance in time and space (i.e., extreme patchiness), requiring  investigation of persistence of abundance across trophic levels to resolve trophic hotspots. Using a 26- yr record of indicators for primary production, secondary (zooplankton and larval ﬁsh), and tertiary (seabirds) consumers, we show distributions of trophic hotspots in the south-ern California Current Ecosystem result from interactions between a strong upwelling center and a productive retention zone with enhanced nutrients, which concentrate prey and preda-tors across multiple trophic levels. Trophic hotspots also overlap with human impacts, includ-ing ﬁsheries extraction of coastal pelagic and groundﬁsh species, as well as intense commercial shipping trafﬁc. Spatial overlap of trophic hotspots with ﬁsheries and shipping increases  vulnerability of the ecosystem to localized depletion of forage ﬁsh, ship strikes on marine  mammals, and pollution.

Experimentally derived rates can be challenging to interpret when methodological assumptions are untested or potentially violated under variable natural conditions, such as the assumed linear grazing response of the dilution technique for estimating rates of phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing impact. Here, we show that grazing nonlinearity can be related to the ratio of initial phytoplankton biomass to the half-saturation parameter in the Holling II model, while not being affected by varying grazer biomass during dilution experiments. From this, we present theory to recover growth and grazing rates from multi-treatment dilution experiments with nonlinear grazing results. We test our analyses with data collected during the California Current Ecosystem-Long-Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) program. We show that using a linear regression in 2-treatment dilution experiments may lead to underestimates of microzooplankton grazing rates, particularly in high-phytoplankton-biomass coastal regions where grazing can be saturated. Using the Holling II grazing model and a correction factor, growth and grazing rates from 2-treatment experiments can also be estimated, as illustrated by application to Lagrangian watertracking studies of growth and grazing dynamics in the CCE.",2017,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1825-1835,,5,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0385,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find a reproducible pattern of body sizedependence of day and night depths occupied, and of DVM. Both the smallest surface-dwelling and the largest deeper-dwelling copepods refrain from migrations, while intermediate-sized individuals show pronounced DVM. This pattern apparently arises as a consequence of size-dependent predation risk. In the size classes of migratory copepods the amplitude of DVM is further modulated by optical attenuation in the ocean water column because increased turbidity decreases encounter rates with visually hunting predators. Long-term changes in the ocean optical environment are expected to alter the vertical distributions of many copepods and thus to affect predator-prey encounters as well as oceanic carbon export.",2016,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,765-770,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0346,,,,CCE; Process_cruise; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods,,,,,"Measuring the quantity and composition of sinking particulate matter is key to understanding biogeochemical processes in the ocean. This has been done in the past with sequencing sediment traps, which collect and store particulate matter in sample bottles for subsequent laboratory analysis. Having a limited number of bottles, these traditional traps force the user to choose between finer time resolution and longer deployment duration. We have built a new sediment trap that analyzes the collected material in situ, eliminating the need to preserve and store the samples. This new instrument, the Sedimentation Event Sensor (SES), captures macro images of the sample with front and back lighting, and takes fluorometric measurements in two bands as proxies for the presence of chlorophyll a and accessory pigments. The SES can process 6200 samples during a single deployment, which is the equivalent of 15 samples per day for more than a year. Here, we describe the design of the SES and present the results of its first three deployments at 3910 m depth. Images and fluorometry data revealed high variability of sinking particulate matter composition on the order of hours. Sedimentation patterns detected by the SES largely agreed with mass flux patterns measured from traditional traps deployed concurrently nearby. Given the functional differences, the SES is best used to complement rather than replace traditional sediment traps.",2016,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,853-863,,12,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0386,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistence statistics may reduce uncertainty about seabird habitat use, improve understanding of the spatio-temporal scales of pelagic food web dynamics, and inform conservation planning. Using 26 years (1987–2012, 47 surveys) of shipboard surveys from a 300K km2 study area within the southern California Current Ecosystem, we conduct a spatial assessment of the inter-annual and seasonal dynamics of the persistence of seabird hotspots and identify recurring sites of elevated seabird species richness and abundance. Previous studies document declines in abundance, but were based on broad spatial standardizations to assess where declines may have occurred. Here, we refine the hypothesis that seabird populations have declined off southern California by focusing on persistently used habitats in nearshore or offshore domains. We demonstrate that spatio-temporal variability of seabird distribution and abundance is characterized by anomalous events embedded within trends. In addition to identifying the locations of persistence of seabird aggregations, we found significant declines in species richness and the density of sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus) and Leach’s storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa); in contrast, black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) abundance appear to be increasing.

A strong positive trend in nitrate ﬂux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat ﬂux. Increased upwelling and nitrate ﬂux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual ﬂuctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published ﬁndings suggests that local wind intensiﬁcation persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes.

These differences in Rrs are transferred to inherent optical properties and further on to estimates of NPP. We estimated NPP for the California Current region from three ocean color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS) using a regionally optimized absorption based primary production model (Aph-PP) of Lee et al.

While the concept of Aph-PP has advantages over traditional chlorophyll-based NPP models, in practical application even the optimized Aph-PP model explained less than 60% of the total variance in NPP which is similar to other NPP algorithms.

Oligotrophic offshore waters create cross-shore gradients of biological and physical properties, which are affected by intense mesoscale eddy activity. The influence of eddies on ecosystem dynamics in EBUS is still in debate. To elucidate the mechanisms that influence the dynamics of ecosystems trapped in eddies, and the relative contribution of horizontal and vertical advection in determining local production, we analyze a particular cyclonic eddy using Lagrangian particle-tracking analyses of numerical Eulerian. The eddy formed in a coastal upwelling system; coastal waters trapped in the eddy enabled it to leave the upwelling region with high concentrations of plankton and nutrients. The ecosystem was initially driven mainly by recycling of biological material. As the eddy moved offshore, production in its core was enhanced compared to eddy exterior waters through Ekman pumping of nitrate from below the euphotic zone; this Ekman pumping was particularly effective due to the shallow nitracline in the eddy compared to eddy exterior waters. Both eddy trapping and Ekman pumping helped to isolate and maintain the ecosystem productivity in the eddy core. This study shows the importance of cyclonic eddies for biological production in EBUS: they contribute both to the redistribution of the coastal upwelling ecosystem and are local regions of enhanced new production. Together, these processes impact cross-shore gradients of important biological properties.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,5566-5588,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0339,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this simplifying principle, we investigated how interactions between trophic levels, resource concentration, and physiological rates structure the planktonic community. Specifically, we used 3 size-structured nutrient-phytoplankton- zooplankton models differing in their trophic interactions, ranging from herbivorous grazing on one size class to omnivorous grazing on multiple size classes. We parameterized our models based on an extensive review of the literature. The maximum phytoplankton growth, maximum microzooplankton grazing, and phytoplankton half-saturation constant were found to vary inversely with size, and the nutrient half-saturation constant scaled positively with size. We examined the emergent community structure in our models under 4 nutrient regimes: 10, 20, 25, and 30 μM total N. In all models under all nutrient conditions, the normalized biomass of both phytoplankton and microzooplankton decreased with increasing size. As nutrients were in creased, phytoplankton biomass was added to larger size classes with little change in the extant smaller size classes; for microzooplankton, spectra elongated and biomass was added to all size classes. The different grazing behaviors among models led to more subtle changes in the community structure. Overall, we found that phytoplankton are top-down controlled and microzooplankton are largely bottomup controlled. Sensitivity analyses showed that both phytoplankton and microzooplankton biomass vary strongly with the size-dependence of the maximum grazing rate. Therefore, this parameter must be known with the greatest accuracy, given its large influence on the emergent community spectra.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,13-33,,,514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0302,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.",Rapid changes and long-term cycles in the benthic megafaunal community observed over 24 years in the abyssal northeast Pacific,Progress in Oceanography,,,,,"The abyssal seafloor community in the NE Pacific (Station M,  4000 m depth) was studied between 2006 and 2012 using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) as part of a continuing 24-year time-series study. New patterns continue to emerge showing that the deep-sea can be dynamic on short time scales, rather than static over long periods. In just over 2 years the community shifted from a sessile, suspension-feeding, sponge-dominated community to a mobile, detritus-feeding, sea cucumber-dominated assemblage. In 2006 megafaunal diversity (Simpson’s Diversity Index, SDI) was high, yet the community was depauperate in terms of density compared to later periods. Over an 18-month period beginning in spring 2011, the densities of mobile organisms increased by nearly an order of magnitude while diversity decreased below 2006 levels. In late 2012 four sea cucumbers (two Peniagone spp., Elpidia sp. A, and Scotoplanes globosa) were at the highest densities recorded since investigations began at Station M in 1989. For a group of 10 echinoderms investigated over the entire study period, we saw evidence of a long-term cycle spanning 2 decades. These changes can be tied to a variable food supply originating in shallow water. Large variations over decadal-scales indicate that remote abyssal communities are dynamic and likely subject to impacts from anthropogenic changes like ocean warming, acidification, and pollution manifested in the upper ocean. The degree of dynamism indicates that one-time or short-term investigations are not sufficient for assessing biological community structure in conservation or exploitation studies in the deep sea.",2014,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1-11,,,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0349,,,,CCE; Published; Sta M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DZDFELJL,journalArticle,2013,"Goldstein, M. C.",Scales of spatial heterogeneity of plastic marine debris in the northeast Pacific Ocean,PLOS ONE,,,,,"Plastic debris has been documented in many marine ecosystems, including remote coastlines, the water column, the deep sea, and subtropical gyres. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), colloquially called the ‘‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch,’’ has been an area of particular scientific and public concern. However, quantitative assessments of the extent and variability of plastic in the NPSG have been limited. Here, we quantify the distribution, abundance, and size of plastic in a subset of the eastern Pacific (approximately 20–40uN, 120–155uW) over multiple spatial scales. Samples were collected in Summer 2009 using surface and subsurface plankton net tows and quantitative visual observations, and Fall 2010 using surface net tows only. We documented widespread, though spatially variable, plastic pollution in this portion of the NPSG and adjacent waters. The overall median microplastic numerical concentration in Summer 2009 was 0.448 particles m22 and in Fall 2010 was 0.021 particles m22, but plastic concentrations were highly variable over the submesoscale (10 s of km). Size-frequency spectra were skewed towards small particles, with the most abundant particles having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.01 cm2. Most microplastic was found on the sea surface, with the highest densities detected in low-wind conditions. The numerical majority of objects were small particles collected with nets, but the majority of debris surface area was found in large objects assessed visually. Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology, as stations with substantial microplastic did not necessarily also contain large visually observable objects. A power analysis of our data suggests that high variability of surface microplastic will make future changes in abundance difficult to detect without substantial sampling effort. Our findings suggest that assessment and monitoring of oceanic plastic debris must account for high spatial variability, particularly in regards to the evaluation of initiatives designed to reduce marine debris.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,e80020,,11,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269,,,,CCE; NPSG; Published; Seaplex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This north–south gradient, which we called A-Front, was formed by the eastward flow of the California Current and separated cooler mesotrophic waters of coastal upwelling origin to the north, from warm oligotrophic waters of likely mixed subarctic–subtropical origin to the south. Plankton biomass and phytoplankton growth rates were two to three times greater on the northern side, and primary production rates were elevated 5-fold to the north. Compared with either of the adjacent waters, the frontal interface was strongly enriched and uniquely defined by a subsurface bloom of large diatoms, elevated concentrations of suspension-feeding zooplankton, high bioacoustical estimates of pelagic fish and enhanced bacterial production and phytoplankton biomass and photosynthetic potential. Such habitats, though small in areal extent, may contribute disproportionately and importantly to regional productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon fluxes and trophic ecology.

Three of the four drifter studies were within the coastal upwelling regime and one drifter study was in a warm-core anticyclonic eddy. Incubation bottle experiments were also conducted to determine the degree of phytoplankton Fe limitation and to assess changes in the concentration of Fe-binding ligands. In the coastal upwelling drifter studies, in situ dFe (1.4–1.8nM) and macronutrients were initially high and declined over time. Fe addition incubation experiments indicated that the phytoplankton community was not Fe limited at the beginning of the coastal upwelling drifter experiments (when μM nitrate:nM dFe ratios were ~7–8). By the end of two of the three drifter studies (when μM nitrate:nM dFe ratios were ~12–19), Fe addition resulted in larger nitrate and silicic acid drawdown, and larger accumulations in chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and diatom and dinoflagellate-specific carotenoid pigments. Fe speciation was measured in situ in three of the four drifter studies with stronger L1-type ligands found to be present in excess of dFe in all samples. In Fe speciation incubation experiments, L1-type ligand production was observed in conjunction with phytoplankton growth under Fe-limiting conditions.

This perception is based primarily on a few case studies and anecdotal evidence, but a formal analysis of global temporal trends in jellyfish populations has been missing. Here, we analyze all available long-term datasets on changes in jellyfish abundance across multiple coastal stations, using linear and logistic mixed models and effect-size analysis to showthat there is norobust evidence for a global increase in jellyfish. Although there has been a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s, this trend was unsubstantiated by effect-size analysis that showed no difference in the proportion of increasing vs. decreasing jellyfish populations over all time periods examined. Rather, the strongest nonrandom trend indicated jellyfish populations undergo larger, worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20-y periodicity, including a rising phase during the 1990s that contributed to the perception of a global increase in jellyfish abundance. Sustained monitoring is required over the next decade to elucidate with statistical confidence whether the weak increasing linear trend in jellyfish after 1970 is an actual shift in the baseline or part of an oscillation. Irrespective of the nature of increase, given the potential damage posed by jellyfish blooms to fisheries, tourism, and other human industries, our findings foretell recurrent phases of rise and fall in jellyfish populations that society should be prepared to face.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1000-1005,,3,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo ?; External_data_user; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historical inorganic carbon measurements are scarce, so the progression of OA in the CCS is unknown. We used a multiple linear regression approach to generate empirical models using oxygen (O2), temperature (T), salinity (S), and sigma theta (σθ) as proxy variables to reconstruct pH, carbonate saturation states, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and total alkalinity (TA) in the southern CCS. The calibration data included high-quality measurements of carbon, oxygen, and other hydrographic variables, collected during a cruise from British Columbia to Baja California in May–June 2007. All resulting empirical relationships were robust, withr2values >0.92 and low root mean square errors. Estimated and measured carbon chemistry matched very well for independent data sets from the CalCOFI and IMECOCAL programs. Reconstructed CCS pH and saturation states for 2005–2011 reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the upper water column. Deeper in the water column, conditions are stable throughout the annual cycle, with perennially low pH and saturation states. Over sub-decadal time scales, these empirical models provide a valuable tool for reconstructing carbonate chemistry related to ocean acidification where direct observations are limited. However, progressive increases in anthropogenic CO2 content of southern CCS water masses must be carefully addressed to apply the models over longer time scales.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,C05033,,C5,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0270,,,,"1615 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modeling; 1635 Oceans; 4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modeling; 4806 Carbon cycling; 4835 Marine inorganic chemistry; CCE; California Current System; Published; aragonite saturation; carbonate chemistry; carbonate saturation; ocean acidification; pH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.",2010-07,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1923-1935,,7,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0137,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secular trend in hypoxia in the SCB over the last 57 years is not monotonic, and reversed trend in the mid-1980s, bringing oxygen concentrations back to levels measured in the late 1950s to early 1960s. Thirty-seven percent of the rockfish (Sebastes spp.) habitat in the Cowcod Conservation Area at 240-350 m depths suffers exposure to hypoxia in the summer of normal years. If current trends in shoaling of low oxygen water continue for another 20 years, rather than reversing as happened previously, we predict loss of 18% of the habitat with 55% of the total habitat exposed to hypoxia.

Climate forcing can alter nutrient availability and predator community composition, and here we show that these shifts may dramatically alter plankton trophic structure, size distributions and biomass. We modeled phytoplankton and zooplankton as a highly resolved size spectrum with size-dependent nutrient uptake and predation and analyzed the model both as a size spectrum and as a food web. Model results identified 2 distinct regimes defined by the average zooplankton feeding preferences. Regime I communities, where planktonic predators are specialists or large relative to prey, had low omnivory, many top predators, low connectance and relatively flat size spectra. Regime II communities, where predators are generalists or small relative to prey, had a high degree of omnivory, no top predators, high connectance and steep size spectra. Model ecosystems with generalist predators had lower size diversity, smaller plankton and gappier size distributions than ecosystems with specialist predators. Nutrient availability had little influence on trophic structure but strongly impacted size structure and biomass. Most surprisingly, phytoplankton biomass sometimes decreased with added nutrients if predators were small relative to prey, implying that both predators and nutrients mediate shifts between bottom-up and top-down control. Based on our synthesized estimates of size-selective feeding parameters, we infer that size and trophic structure should be strongly affected by abundances of generalist, bloom-forming taxa such as salps and jellyfish, many of which are responsive to ocean temperature. Size-selective feeding fundamentally affects community structure and is a likely mechanism of change in planktonic ecosystems where community composition varies with temperature.",2010,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1-15,,,413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0097,,,,CCE LTER; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential for their prediction in the ocean and possible management depends upon the characteristics of the regime shifts: their drivers (from anthropogenic to natural), scale (from the local to the basin) and potential for management action (from adaptation to mitigation). We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean, illustrating our approach with three welldocumented examples: the North Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs. We conclude that the ability to adapt to, or manage, regime shifts depends upon their uniqueness, our understanding of their causes and linkages among ecosystem components and our observational capabilities.",2008,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,402-409,,7,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo 155; External_data_user; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time-varying spatial gradients within filaments affect net cross-shore fluxes of physical, biological, and chemical tracers but require high-resolution measurements to accurately estimate. In June 2017, the California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research program process cruise (P1706) conducted repeat sections by an autonomous Spray glider and a towed SeaSoar to investigate the role of one such coastal upwelling feature, the Morro Bay filament, which was characterized by enhanced cross-filament gradients (both physical and biological) and an along-filament jet. Within the jet, speeds were up to 0.78 m/s and the offshore transport was 1.5 Sverdrups (3.8 Sverdrups) in the upper 100 m (500 m). A climatological data product from the sustained California Underwater Glider Network provided necessary information for water mass differentiation. The analysis revealed that the cold, salty side of the filament carried recently upwelled California Undercurrent water and corresponded to higher chlorophyll-a fluorescence than the warm, fresh side, which carried California Current water. Thus, there was a convergence of heterogeneous water masses within the core of the filament’s offshore-flowing jet. These water masses have different geographic origins and thermohaline characteristics, which has implications for filament-related cross-shore fluxes and submesoscale-tomesoscale biological community structure gradients.",2021,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,13 pgs,,,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0495,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While rhizarians have been recently described as important contributors to both silica and carbon fluxes, we lack the most basic information about their ecological preferences. Here, using the in situ imaging (Underwater Vision Profiler 5), we characterize the vertical ecological niches of different test-bearing rhizarian taxa in the southern California Current Ecosystem. We define three vertical layers between 0-500 m occupied, respectively, by 1) surface dwelling and mostly symbiont-bearing rhizarians (Acantharia and Collodaria), 2) flux-feeding phaeodarians in the lower epipelagic (100-200 m), and 3) Foraminifera and Phaeodaria populations adjacent to the Oxygen Minimum Zone. We then use Generalized Additive Models to analyze the response of each rhizarian category to a suite of environmental variables. The models explain between 13 and 93% of the total variance observed for the different groups. While temperature and the depth of the deep chlorophyll maximum, appear as the main factors influencing populations in the upper 200 m, silicic acid concentration is the most important variable related to the abundance of mesopelagic phaeodarians. The relative importance of biotic interactions (e.g., predation, parasitism) is still to be considered, in order to fully incorporate the dynamics of test-bearing pelagic rhizarians in ecological and biogeochemical models.",2020,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0474,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine migration timing (inferred from the local onset and cessation of blue whale calls recorded on seafoor-mounted hydrophones), environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll a), and prey (spring krill biomass from annual net tow surveys) during a 10 year period (2008–2017) in waters of the Southern California Region where blue whales feed in the summer. Colder sea surface temperature anomalies the previous season were correlated with greater krill biomass the following year, and earlier arrival by blue whales. Our results demonstrate a plastic response of blue whales to interannual variability and the importance of krill as a driving force behind migration timing. A decadal- scale increase in temperature due to climate change has led to blue whales extending their overall time in Southern California. By the end of our 10-year study, whales were arriving at the feeding grounds more than one month earlier, while their departure date did not change. Conservation strategies will need to account for increased anthropogenic threats resulting from longer times at the feeding grounds.",2020,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,7710,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0475,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C:234Th ratios of sinking particles collected by a surface-tethered sediment trap (C:234ThST) varied from 2.3 to 20.5 μmol C dpm−1 over a depth range of 47–150 m. C:234ThST was significantly greater (by a factor of 1.8) than C:234Th ratios of suspended >51-μm particles collected in the same water parcels with in situ pumps. C:234Th ratios of large (>200-μm) sinking particles also exceeded those of smaller sinking particles. C:234ThST decreased with depth from the base of the euphotic zone through the upper twilight zone. C:234ThST was positively correlated with several indices of ecosystem productivity including particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations, mesozooplankton biomass, and the fraction of Chl >20-μm. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression suggested that decaying phytoplankton blooms exhibited higher C:234ThST than actively growing blooms at similar biomass levels. C:234ThST was positively correlated with indices of the fractional contribution of fecal pellets in sediment traps when the proportion of fecal pellets was low in the traps, likely because of a correlation between mesozooplankton biomass and other indices of ecosystem productivity. However, when fecal pellets were a more important component of sinking material, C:234ThST decreased with increasing fecal pellet content. C:234ThST was also positively correlated with the Si:C ratio of sinking particles. Across the dataset (and across depths) a strong correlation was found between C:234ThST and the ratio of vertically-integrated POC to vertically-integrated total water column 234Th (vC:234Thtot). A mechanistic one-layer, two-box model of thorium sorption and desorption was invoked to explain this correlation. Two empirical models (one using vC:234Thtot; one using depth and vertically-integrated Chl) were developed to predict C:234Th ratios in this coastal upwelling biome. The former regression (log10(C:234ThST) = 0.43 × log10(vC:234Thtot) + 0.53) was found to also be a reasonable predictor for C:234ThST from diverse regions including the Southern Ocean, Sargasso Sea, Subarctic North Pacific, and Eastern Tropical North Pacific.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1-15,,,212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0428,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We coupled a mechanistic thorium sorption and desorption model to a one-dimensional particle sinking model that uses realistic particle settling velocity spectra. The model generates estimates of 238Ue234Th disequilibrium, particulate organic carbon concentration, and the C:234Th ratio of sinking particles, which are then compared to in situ measurements from quasi-Lagrangian studies conducted on six cruises in the California Current Ecosystem. Broad patterns observed in in situ measurements, including decreasing C:234Th ratios with depth and a strong correlation between sinking C:234Th and the ratio of vertically-integrated particulate organic carbon (POC) to vertically-integrated total water column 234Th, were accurately recovered by models assuming either a power law distribution of sinking speeds or a double log normal distribution of sinking speeds. Simulations suggested that the observed decrease in C:234Th with depth may be driven by preferential remineralization of carbon by particle-attached microbes. However, an alternate model structure featuring complete consumption and/or disaggregation of particles by mesozooplankton (e.g. no preferential remineralization of carbon) was also able to simulate decreasing C:234Th with depth (although the decrease was weaker), driven by 234Th adsorption onto slowly sinking particles. Model results also suggest that during bloom decays C:234Th ratios of sinking particles should be higher than expected (based on contemporaneous water column POC), because high settling velocities minimize carbon remineralization during sinking",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,37-51,,,211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0451,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oceanogr.,,,,,"Euphausiids are important prey for many marine organisms and often occur in patchy aggregations. Euphausiid predators, such as blue whales, may become concentrated in the vicinity of these aggregations. We investigated an area called Nine Mile Bank (NMB) near San Diego, California, defined by an area of steep bathymetry, to determine whether the frequent whale sightings in that locality can be explained by the distribution of euphausiids across the bank and by the vertical distribution of euphausiids in the water column. Thysanoessa spinifera, the strongly preferred blue whale prey euphausiid in this area, was consistently more abundant on the bank or inshore of it than offshore. In contrast, Euphausia pacifica, a minor blue whale prey item, was much more abundant and distributed across the study region. Adults of both species were concentrated in a stratum corresponding to the feeding depth of blue whales. Other euphausiids that form a negligible part of the blue whale diet also showed no association with NMB. Both blue whales and their primary prey species Thysanoessa spinifera were more abundant on or inshore of the bank than offshore, suggesting that the bank may serve as an offshore limit of high prey abundance that helps to concentrate blue whales.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,390-405,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0425,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relative importance of these precursors and the timescale on which they impact the tropics remain unclear. Using a 30‐member ensemble of the Community Earth System Model as the control climate, we generate two additional members where the NPMM and SPMM are selectively suppressed. We find that both meridional modes energize the tropical variance independently on different timescales. The absence of NPMM leads to a significant reduction of the tropical interannual variability (~35%), while the absence of the SPMM has no appreciable impact on ENSO but significantly reduces the TPDV (~30%). While the relative importance of the NPMM and SPMM may be model dependent, the stochastic atmospheric variability in the extratropics that energizes the meridional modes emerges as a key source of TPDV",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,906-915,,2,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0433,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F.",Spatial planning of Marine Aquaculture under Climate Decadal Variability: A case study for Mussel Farms in California,Frontiers of Marine Science,,,,,"The growth of marine aquaculture over the 21st century is a promising venture for food security because of its potential to fulfill the seafood deficit in the future. However, to maximize the use of marine space and its resources, the spatial planning of marine aquaculture needs to consider the regimes of climate variability in the oceanic environment, which are characterized by large-amplitude interannual to decadal fluctuations. It is common to see aquaculture spatial planning schemes that do not take variability into consideration. This assumption may be critical for management and for the expansion of marine aquaculture, because projects require investments of capital and need to be profitable to establish and thrive. We analyze the effect of climate variability on the profitability of hypothetical mussel aquaculture systems in the Southern California Bight. Using historical environmental data from 1981 to 2008, we combine mussel production and economics models at different sites along the coast to estimate the Net Present Value as an economic indicator of profitability. We find that productivity of the farms exhibits a strong coherent behavior with marketed decadal fluctuations that are connected to climate of the North Pacific Basin, in particular linked to the phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). This decadal variability has a strong impact on profitability both temporally and spatially, and emerges because of the mussels’ dependence on multiple oceanic environmental variables. Depending on the trend of the decadal regimes in mussel productivity and the location of the farms, these climate fluctuations will affect cost recovery horizon and profitability for a given farm. These results suggest that climate variability should be taken into consideration by managers and investors on decision making to maximize profitability.",2019,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,253,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0449,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viruses are key players in ocean biogeochemical cycles6,7, yet little is known about how viral infection specifically impacts diatom populations. Here, we show that Si limitation facilitates virus infection and mortality in diatoms in the highly productive coastal waters of the California Current Ecosystem. Using metatranscriptomic analysis of cell-associated diatom viruses and targeted quantification of extracellular viruses, we found a link between Si stress and the early, active and lytic stages of viral infection. This relationship was also observed in cultures of the bloom-forming diatom Chaetoceros tenuissimus, where Si stress accelerated virus-induced mortality.

Canyons may be important to benthic-pelagic ecosystem coupling, but their role in concentrating plankton and structuring pelagic communities is not well known. We hypothesize that at the scale of a large marine ecosystem, canyons provide a critical habitat network, which maintain energy fow and trophic interactions. We evaluate canyon characteristics relative to the distribution and abundance of krill, critically important prey in the California Current Ecosystem. Using a geological database, we conducted a census of canyon locations, evaluated their dimensions, and quantifed functional relationships with krill hotspots (i.e., sites of persistently elevated abundance) derived from hydro-acoustic surveys. We found that 76% of krill hotspots occurred within and adjacent to canyons. Most krill hotspots were associated with large shelf-incising canyons. Krill hotspots and canyon dimensions displayed similar coherence as a function of latitude and indicate a potential regional habitat network. The latitudinal migration of many fsh, seabirds and mammals may be enhanced by using this canyon-krill network to maintain foraging opportunities. Biogeographic assessments and predictions of krill and krill-predator distributions under climate change may be improved by accounting for canyons in habitat models.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,7579,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0413,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oceanogr.: Methods,,,,,"We present the design and preliminary results from ocean deployments of Zooglider, a new autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider. Zooglider is a modified Spray glider that includes a low-power camera (Zoocam) with telecentric lens and a custom dual frequency Zonar (200 and 1000 kHz). The Zoocam quantifies zooplankton and marine snow as they flow through a defined volume inside a sampling tunnel. Images are acquired on average every 5 cm from a maximum operating depth of ~ 400 m to the sea surface. Biofouling is mitigated using a dual approach: an ultraviolet light-emitting diode and a mechanical wiper. The Zonar permits differentiation of large and small acoustic backscatterers in larger volumes than can be sampled optically. Other sensors include a pumped conductivity, temperature, and depth unit and chlorophyll a fluorometer. Zooglider enables fully autonomous in situ measurements of mesozooplankton distributions, together with the three-dimensional orientation of organisms and marine snow in relation to other biotic and physical properties of the ocean water column. It is well suited to resolve thin layers and microscale ocean patchiness. Battery capacity supports 50 d of operations. Zooglider includes two-way communications via Iridium, permitting near-real–time transmission of data from each dive profile, as well as interactive instrument control from remote locations for adaptive sampling.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0430,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, giant siliceous rhizarians (>500 μm), including Radiolaria and Phaeodaria, are important contributors to oceanic carbon pools but little is known about their contribution to the marine silica cycle. We report the first analyses of giant phaeodarians to bSiO2 export in the California Current Ecosystem. We measured the silica content of single rhizarian cells ranging in size from 470 to 3,920 μm and developed allometric equations to predict silica content (0.37–43.42 μg Si/cell) from morphometric measurements. Using sediment traps to measure phaeodarian fluxes from the euphotic zone on four cruises, we calculated bSiO2 export produced by two families, the Aulosphaeridae and Castanellidae. Biogenic silica export ranged from <0.01 to 0.63 mmol Si · m 2 · day 1. These two families alone contributed on average 10% (range 0–80%) of total bSiO2 export from the euphotic zone. Their proportional contributions increased substantially in more oligotrophic regions with lower bSiO2 fluxes. Using the in situ Underwater Vision Profiler 5, we characterized vertical distributions of the giant phaeodarian family Aulosphaeridae to a depth of 500 m and inferred their contribution to bSiO2 export in deeper waters. We found a significant increase of Aulosphaeridae export (<0.01 to 2.82 mmol Si · m 2 · day 1) when extended to mesopelagic depths. Using a global data set of in situ profiles, we estimated the significance of Aulosphaeridae to bSiO2 export and revealed that they can act as major exporters of bSiO2 to the mesopelagic zone in various regions.",2018,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,987-1004,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0406,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The North Pacific heat wave interacted with an El Niño developing in the equatorial Pacific in 2015. Weekly periods of exceptionally high temperature anomalies (>2˚C) occurred until the start of the El Niño (winter of 2015), when SSTs were still high but not as high as those due to the marine heat wave. During the 2015–16 El Niño, the depth of the 26.0 kg m–3 isopycnal (d26.0) was considerably shallower than during the 1982–83 and 1997–98 events. The area affected by the marine heat wave and the 2015–16 El Niño in the mixed layer was comparable to the 1997–98 El Niño, but lasted longer. Water column stratification in the upper 100 m during 2015–16 was as strong as the most extreme values during the 1997–98 El Niño. This stratification was primarily driven by the warming of the upper 100 m. Despite notable perturbations, the effects of the 2015– 16 El Niño on hydrographic properties in the CalCOFI domain were not as strong as those observed during the 1997–98 El Niño. Warm ocean conditions, stratification, nutrient suppression, and silicic acid stress likely favored initiation of a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom in fall 2014. Very low zooplankton displacement volumes were associated with anomalously warm and saline surface waters off Baja California. In contrast, during the 1997–98 El Niño, zooplankton volume was near average. Off California, pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) adults were abundant in the water column and frequently washed up on beaches of southern California from January 2015 into 2016, and central California by September 2015. Glider measurements of integrated transport up to June 2015 did not detect anomalous northward advection. As expected, HF radar indicated northward surface currents along the central California coast in fall and winter 2015–16. Northward advection appeared to be much stronger during the 1997–98 El Niño. Throughout 2015–16, the zooplankton community on the Oregon shelf was dominated by lipid-poor tropical and sub-tropical copepods and gelatinous zooplankton, indicating poor feeding conditions for small fishes that are prey for juvenile salmon. The presence of rarely encountered species increased copepod species richness during 2015–16 to levels higher than the 1998 El Niño. We infer that the unusual copepod vagrants of 2015–16 originated from an offshore and southwesterly source; an important difference from the southerly origin of vagrants during the 1997–98 El Niño. The very warm conditions caused sardine spawning to shift from central California to Oregon. Mesopelagic fish assemblage off southern California exhibited higher  abundances of species with southern affinities, and lower abundances of species with northern affinities. Forage fish (Pacific herring, northern anchovy, and Pacific sardine) were much less abundant in 2015–16 compared to previous years. In contrast, catches of salmon were close to average off northern California. Catches of young-ofthe- year rockfishes were high off central California, but low off both northern and southern California.

Oceans,,,,,"The biological carbon pump is responsible for the transport of  5–20 Pg C yr21 from the surface into the deep ocean but its variability is poorly understood due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying planktonic processes. In fact, algorithms designed to estimate carbon export from satellite products incorporate fundamentally different assumptions about the relationships between plankton biomass, productivity, and export efficiency. To test the alternate formulations of export efficiency in remotesensing algorithms formulated by Dunne et al. (2005), Laws et al. (2011), Henson et al. (2011), and Siegel et al. (2014), we have compiled in situ measurements (temperature, chlorophyll, primary production, phytoplankton biomass and size structure, grazing rates, net chlorophyll change, and carbon export) made during Lagrangian process studies on seven cruises in the California Current Ecosystem and Costa Rica Dome. A food-web based approach formulated by Siegel et al. (2014) performs as well or better than other empirical formulations, while simultaneously providing reasonable estimates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing rates. By tuning the Siegel et al. (2014) algorithm to match in situ grazing rates more accurately, we also obtain better in situ carbon export measurements. Adequate representations of food-web relationships and grazing dynamics are therefore crucial to improving the accuracy of export predictions made from satellite– derived products. Nevertheless, considerable unexplained variance in export remains and must be explored before we can reliably use remote sensing products to assess the impact of climate change on biologically mediated carbon sequestration.",2015,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,7208–7222,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0343,,,,CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Series,,,,,"Estimates of growth and grazing mortality rates for different size classes and taxa of natural picophytoplankton assemblages were measured in mixed-layer experiments conducted in 3 regions of the eastern Pacific: the California Current Ecosystem, Costa Rica Dome, and equatorial Pacific. Contrary to expectation, size-dependent rates for cells between 0.45 and 4.0 μm in diameter showed no systematic trends with cell size both in and among regions. For all size classes, mean ± SD growth rates ranged from −0.70 ± 0.17 to 0.83 ± 0.13 d−1 and grazing rates between −0.07 ± 0.13 and 1.17 ± 0.10 d−1. Taxon-specific growth rates for Prochlorococcus ranged from 0.17 ± 0.12 to 0.59 ± 0.01 d−1, for Synechococcus from 0.68 ± 0.03 to 0.97 ± 0.04 d−1, for picoeukaryotes from 0.46 ± 0.13 to 1.03 ± 0.06 d−1, and for all cells combined between 0.45 ± 0.03 and 0.65 ± 0.02 d−1. For grazing, Prochlorococcus rates ranged between 0.02 ± 0.12 and 0.66 ± 0.02 d−1, Synechococcus rates between 0.24 ± 0.08 and 0.92 ± 0.05 d−1, for picoeukaryotes between 0.19 ± 0.10 and 0.78 ± 0.09 d−1, and for all cells between 0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.75 ± 0.02 d−1.

Lo",State of the California Current 2012-13: No Such Thing as an “Average” Year,CalCOFI Reports,,,,,"This report reviews the state of the California Current System (CCS) between winter 2012 and spring 2013, and includes observations from Washington State to Baja California. During 2012, large-scale climate modes indicated the CCS remained in a cool, productive phase present since 2007. The upwelling season was delayed north of 42˚N, but regions to the south, especially 33˚ to 36˚N, experienced average to above average upwelling that persisted throughout the summer. Contrary to the indication of high production suggested by the climate indices, chlorophyll observed from surveys and remote sensing was below average along much of the coast. As well, some members of the forage assemblages along the coast experienced low abundances in 2012 surveys. Specifically, the concentrations of all lifestages observed directly or from egg densities of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, and northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, were less than previous years’ survey estimates. However, 2013 surveys and observations indicate an increase in abundance of northern anchovy. During winter 2011/2012, the increased presence of northern copepod species off northern California was consistent with stronger southward transport. Krill and small-fraction zooplankton abundances, where examined, were generally above average. North of 42˚N, salps returned to typical abundances in 2012 after greater observed concentrations in 2010 and 2011. In contrast, salp abundance off central and southern California increased after a period of southward transport during winter 2011/2012. Reproductive success of piscivorous Brandt’s cormorant, Phalacrocorax penicillatus, was reduced while planktivorous Cassin’s auklet, Ptychoramphus aleuticus was elevated. Differences between the productivity of these two seabirds may be related to the available forage assemblage observed in the surveys. California sea lion pups from San Miguel Island were undernourished resulting in a pup mortality event perhaps in response to changes in forage availability. Limited biological data were available for spring 2013, but strong winter upwelling coastwide indicated an early spring transition, with the strong upwelling persisting into early summer.",2013,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,37-71,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0300,,,,CALCOFI; CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G.",Sharp gradients in phytoplankton community structure across a frontal zone in the California Current Ecosystem,Journal of Plankton Research,,,,,"Spatial variability of plankton biomass, community composition and size structure was investigated across a strong frontal transition (A-Front) in the southern California Current Ecosystem in October 2008. Depth profiles were taken across a 25-km transect of nine stations sampled semi-synoptically during one night and for 3 days following drifter arrays in the adjacent water masses. Community compositions are compared based on analyses by digital epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and pigment composition by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Our results show three assemblages sharply delineated in space, with plankton at the front being compositionally distinct and biomass elevated relative to either of the adjacent water masses. Depth-averaged chlorophyll a (Chl a) varied by a factor of 2.3 (0.35–0.81 mg Chl a L21) and autotrophic carbon (AC) varied almost 3-fold (13.6–35.4 mg C L21) across the front. One of the most striking features was a sharp gradient in the distribution of Prochlorococcus (PRO) and Synechococcus (SYN), with PRO located in the warmer oligotrophic waters on the south side of the front and SYN located in the cooler mesotrophic waters to the north. Both PRO and SYN had local biomass minima directly at the front. The peak in phytoplankton biomass at the front was dominated by large (.20 mm) diatom cells, comprising 71% of the total community biomass. In contrast to previous studies of frontal features in the southern California Current, our study of the A-Front shows strong frontal enhancement of phytoplankton biomass and a shift of phytoplankton size structure towards larger cells.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,778-789,,9,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0208,,,,CCE; P0810; Process_cruise; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large-scale distributions of frontal frequency of both SST (FFsst) and of Chl (FFchl) had a 500–700 km wide band of elevated values (4–7%) along the coast that roughly coincided with the area of increased mesoscale eddy activity. FFsst and FFchl were positively correlated at monthly and seasonal frequencies, but the year-to-year variations were not significantly correlated. The long-period (1 year and longer) variability in FFsst is influenced by the large-scale SST gradient, while at shorter timescales the influence of the Coastal Upwelling Index is evident. In contrast with FFsst, FFchl variability is less related to the coherent large-scale forcing and has stronger sensitivity to local forcings in individual areas. Decadal-scale increasing trends in the frequency of both SST and Chl fronts were detected in the Ensenada Front area (general area of the A-Front study) and corresponded to, respectively, trends towards colder SST and increasing chlorophyll-a concentration.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,749-760,,9,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0218,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CALCOFI; CCE; P0605; P0704; P0810; P1106; P1208; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAXW3WJ2,journalArticle,2012,"Bjorkstedt, E. P.",State of the California Current 2011-2012: Ecosystems respond to local forcing as La Niña wavers and wanes,CalCOFI Reports,,,,,"The state of the California Current System (CCS) since spring 2011 has evolved in response to dissipation of La Niña through spring and summer, resurgence of cooler La Niña conditions in fall and winter, and finally a transition towards ENSO-neutral conditions in spring 2012. The resurgence of La Niña was uneven, however, as indicated by variable responses in broad climate indices such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the multivariate ENSO index, and by latitudinal variability in the timing, strength, and duration of upwelling relative to climatological means. Across the CCS, various measures of ecosystem productivity exhibited a general decline in 2011 relative to 2010, but the magnitude of these declines varied substantially among taxa. Available observations indicate regional variability in climate forcing and ecosystem responses throughout the CCS, continuing a pattern that has emerged with increasing clarity over the past several years. In 2011–12, regional variability was again a consequence of southern regions exhibiting a relatively mild response to climate forcing, in this case tending towards climatological means, while northern regions showed somewhat greater effects of delayed or weaker-than-normal upwelling. In addition to the effects of local and basin-scale forcing, long-term information from the tropical and northern Pacific Ocean. This review provides a broad temporal and spatial context for observations that focus more specifically on patterns and structure in physical forcing and responses at scales that span the entire CCS. Second, we summarize the state of the CCS in terms of available hydrographic and plankton data collected during repeated ship-based surveys that occupy designated stations at more or less regular intervals throughout the year (fig. 1). Third, building from our synthesis of the state of the ecosystem “base” of the CCS, we review data on abundance or productivity of several taxa at higher trophic levels based on observations from directed surveys or place-based study sites (fig. 2). Such taxa can respond to climate variability and change on multiple time scales, ranging from days to decades (Melin et al. 2010; Sydeman et al. 2012), and as such, may be useful as integrative indicators of ecosystem state. Finally, in the Discussion, we synthesize observations throughout the CCS to assess how the state of the CCS has evolved through the past year, and provide a look towards the future. effects of local and basin-scale forcing, long-term observations off southern California show declines in dissolved oxygen and increases in nutrient concentrations in waters below the mixed layer, trends that are consistent with recent predictions of how global warming will affect the characteristics of upwelling source waters in the CCS. Such trends must be accounted for more comprehensively in ongoing assessment of the state of the California Current and its responses to environmental forcing. At the time of writing, tropical conditions are ENSO neutral and forecast to transition into El Niño in late 2012. This, combined with unusually high abundances of diverse gelatinous taxa throughout much of the CCS during spring 2012, suggests that the ongoing evolution of the state of the California Current might take a particularly unusual path in the coming year.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,41-76,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0276,,,,CALCOFI; CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to collect and synthesise existing pteropod (Gymnosomata, Thecosomata and Pseudothecosomata) abundance and biomass data, in order to evaluate the global distribution of pteropod carbon biomass, with a particular emphasis on temporal and spatial patterns. We collected 25 939 data points from several online databases and 41 scientific articles. These data points corresponded to observations from 15 134 stations, where 93% of observations were of shelled pteropods (Thecosomata) and 7% of non-shelled pteropods (Gymnosomata). The biomass data has been gridded onto a 360 × 180  grid, with a vertical resolution of 33 depth levels. Both the raw data file and the gridded data in NetCDF format can be downloaded from PANGAEA, doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.777387. Data were collected between 1950– 2010, with sampling depths ranging from 0–2000 m. Pteropod biomass data was either extracted directly or derived through converting abundance to biomass with pteropod-specific length to carbon biomass conversion algorithms. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the data were distributed quite evenly throughout the year, whereas sampling in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) was biased towards winter and summer values. 86% of all biomass values were located in the NH, most (37 %) within the latitudinal band of 30–60  N. The range of global biomass values spanned over four orders of magnitude, with mean and median (non-zero) biomass values of 4.6 mg Cm−3 (SD = 62.5) and 0.015 mgCm−3, respectively. The highest mean biomass was located in the SH within the 70–80  S latitudinal band (39.71 mg Cm−3, SD = 93.00), while the highest median biomass was in the NH, between 40–50  S (0.06 mg Cm−3, SD = 79.94). Shelled pteropods constituted a mean global carbonate biomass of 23.17 mg CaCO3 m−3 (based on non-zero records). Total biomass values were lowest in the equatorial regions and equally high at both poles. Pteropods were found at least to depths of 1000 m, with the highest biomass values located in the surface layer (0–10 m) and gradually decreasing with depth, with values in excess of 100 mg Cm−3 only found above 200m depth. Tropical species tended to concentrate at greater depths than temperate or high-latitude species. Global biomass levels in the NH were relatively invariant over the seasonal cycle, but more seasonally variable in the SH. The collected database provides a valuable tool for modellers for the study of marine ecosystem processes and global biogeochemical cycles. By extrapolating regional biomass to a global scale, we established global pteropod biomass to add up to 500 Tg C.",2012,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,167-186,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo ?; External_data_user; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D.",Spatial-temporal scales of synchrony in marine zooplankton biomass and abundance patterns: A world-wide comparison,Progress in Oceanography,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000303958000002,"Large scale synchrony in the fluctuations of abundance or biomass of marine fish populations in regions on opposite sides of an ocean basin or in different oceans have been viewed as externally forced by correlated environmental stochasticity (e.g., common external forcing), most often as atmospheric teleconnections of basin-to-global scale atmospheric forcing, such as the Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Specific causal mechanisms have been difficult to unequivocally discover, but possible mechanisms include influences on habitat temperatures, productivity operating through bottom-up (trophodynamic) mechanisms or direct climate influence on the fish populations (top-down mechanisms). For small pelagic fishes (sardines and anchovies) in widely separated large marine ecosystems that lack obvious ocean interconnectivity, it has been argued that the teleconnections may be atmospheric, acting on the fishes directly and propagating to the ecosystem from the middle out (wasp-waist species). Zooplankton biomass or abundance time series data from >100 sites world-wide are used to examine the spatial scales of coherent temporal synchrony. If spatially correlated environmental factors (like climate) are important for creating synchrony in fish populations via bottom-up effects (trophic interactions involving fish prey, e.g., zooplankton), then we would expect to observe synchrony in fluctuations of zooplankton biomass/numbers at spatial scales similar to those found for fish species. Zooplankton biomass/abundance have 50% spatial decorrelation scales of ca. 700-1400 km and scales of significant coherence that extend to separation distances of ca. 3000 km. These are also the spatial scales of environmental (sea surface temperature) synchrony from our global analysis. These scales are slightly greater than the 50% decorrelation scales of ca. 150-700 km for recruitment synchrony in Atlantic marine fish and survival and recruitment synchrony of Northeast Pacific salmonids (150-1000 km depending on species). However, the spatial scales of synchrony of annual zooplankton biomass anomalies in the Humboldt Current, California Current and Kuroshio ecosystems of the Pacific are much too small (ca. 2000 km) to be directly causal of the basin-scale (7000-15,000 km) synchrony exhibited by sardine and/or anchovy populations in those ecosystems.

The specific gravity of mesopelagic fish from the northeastern Pacific Ocean and its implications for acoustic backscatter. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: . Knowledge of the species present, their morphology, and their size distribution is required to infer biomass from acoustic surveys of fish. The gas content and specific gravity of the body (with gas removed), ρf, was measured for 71 species of mesopelagic fish in the NE Pacific Ocean. Those species that have functional swimbladders when large maintain constant ρf with increasing body size. Species without functional swimbladders as adults show decreased ρf with increasing body size. The acoustic-backscattering cross-section, σbs, was modelled for all individuals collected from three fish species that differed in the presence of a gas-filled swimbladder. The change in σbs with increasing body size was markedly different between the three. The low body density of those mesopelagic fish without gas-filled swimbladders greatly reduces their σbs. In species of fish that possess a functional swimbladder as juveniles and in which the swimbladder regresses with growth, the σbs first decreases, then increases with increased body size.

The model assumes allometric scaling of biological parameters. This particular version of the model (herbivorous zooplankton only) has analytical solutions that allow efficient exploration of the effects of allomeuic dependencies of various biological processes on the model's equilibrium solutions. The model shows that there are constraints on the possible combinations of allometric scalings of the biological rates that will allow ecosystems to be structured as we observe (larger organisms added as the total biomass increases). The diversity (number of size classes occupied) of the ecosystem is the result of simultaneous bottom-up and top-down control: resources determine which classes can exist; predation determines which classes do exist. Thus, the simultaneous actions of bottom-up and top-down controls are essential for maintaining and structuring planktonic ecosystems. One important conclusion from this model is that there are multiple, independent ways of obtaining any given biomass spectrum, and that the spectral slope is not, in and of itself, very informative concerning the underlying dynamics. There is a clear need for improved size-resolved field measurements of biological rates; these will both elucidate biological processes in the field, and allow strong testing of size-structured models of planktonic ecosystems.",2010-08,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,1121-1130,,8,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0127,,,,CCE LTER; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8V4GT76Z,journalArticle,2010,"Bjorkstedt, E. P.",State of the California Current 2009-2010: Regional variation persists through transition from La Niña to El Niño (and back?),CalCOFI Reports,,,,,"This report summarizes observations of the California Current System (CCS) from Baja California, Mexico to Oregon for the period from spring 2009 through spring 2010. During this period, changes in the state of the CCS reflected a transition from cool La Niña conditions into and through a short-lived, relatively weak El Niño event. Weaker than normal upwelling and several extended relaxation events contributed to warming over much of the CCS during summer 2009, especially in the north. Moderation of La Niña conditions in the CCS coincided with the development of El Niño conditions in the equatorial Pacific, yet manifested well in advance of any evidence for direct effects of El Niño on the CCS. Responses to El Niño in fall 2009 and winter 2009–2010 appear to have varied substantially with latitude: conditions off southern California returned to near climatological values with the decline of La Niña, and did not indicate any subsequent response to El Niño, yet the northern CCS warmed subtantially following the decline of La Niña and was strongly affected by intense downwelling during winter 2009–2010. The 2009–2010 El Niño diminished rapidly in early 2010, and upwelling off central and southern California resumed unusually early and strongly for a spring following an El Niño, but recovery from El Niño in early 2010 appears to be less robust in the northern CCS. Thus, despite dynamic changes in the overall state of the California Current, 2009–2010 continued the recent pattern of strong regional variability across the CCS.",2010,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,39-69,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0257,,,,CALCOFI; CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observations reported here are based on contributions from various ocean observing programs along the West Coast of North America. Basin-scale indicators were variable or neutral over the last year. This indeterminate forcing was reflected in conditions in the CCS where no coherent patterns emerged, i.e., no single “state” could be ascribed to the system. Rather, regional or local processes dominated observed patterns. Similar to last year, delayed upwelling off Oregon and central California dramatically affected higher trophic levels: euphausiid recruitment was delayed and as a likely consequence seabird productivity off Central California was extremely depressed. For example, Cassin’s auklet had a complete reproductive failure, similar to 2006. Observations during the spring of 2007 demonstrate that these patterns were ephemeral since upwelling was normal and seabird productivity improved. Off southern and Baja California, upwelling-favorable winds were also weak or delayed during 2006, but biological consequences appear to have been relatively minor.",2007,2022-12-16 19:26:41,2022-12-16T19:26:41Z,,33-66,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0277,,,,CALCOFI; CCE; Published,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
