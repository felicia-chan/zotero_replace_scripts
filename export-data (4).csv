We confirm that contrary to several global algorithms export efficiency (e-ratio = export/primary productivity) is negatively correlated with net primary productivity. We find that linear models with a steeper slope of EF relative to NPP produce better estimates of the variability range. Choice of the EF model parameterization can more than double the estimate of temporal variability (standard deviation) in satellite-derived EF time series. The best estimates of EF were obtained when using average NPP during a preceding period of ~7–8 days.

Model results present well-constrained snapshots of ecosystem nitrogen and stableisotopefluxes. New production is supported by upwelled nitrate, not nitrogenfixation. Protistivory (ratherthan herbivory) was the most important feeding mode for mesozooplankton, which rely heavily onmicrozooplankton prey. Mesozooplankton play a central role in vertical nitrogen export, primarily throughactive transport of nitrogen consumed in the surface layer and excreted at depth, which comprised anaverage 36–46% of total export. Detritus or aggregate feeding is also an important mode of resourceacquisition by mesozooplankton and regeneration of nutrients within the euphotic zone. As a consequence,the ratio of passively sinking particle export to phytoplankton production is very low in the CRD. Comparisonsto similar models constrained with data from the nearby equatorial Pacific demonstrate that the dominant roleof vertical migrators to the biological pump is a unique feature of the CRD. However, both regions showefficient nitrogen transfer from mesozooplankton to higher trophic levels (as expected for regions with largefish, cetacean, and seabird populations) despite the dominance of protists as major grazers of phytoplankton.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1815-1832","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0438; AR2019?

Several studies have reported on the temporal and spatial variability of primary production and gravitational export in the CCE. However, few studies have quantified the partitioning of net primary and new production into other reservoirs of detrital organic matter. This study tested the hypothesis that nonsinking detrital reservoirs are an exportable reservoir of new production in the CCE with samples collected by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation survey between 2008 and 2010. Water column gradients in nitrate (NO3) and total organic carbon (TOC; which excludes sinking particulate organic carbon) were used to estimate potential rates of new production (PNew) and TOC production (PTOC), respectively. The PTOC:PNew varied between 0.16 and 0.56 and often increased with indicators of enhanced autotrophic production. At times, surface stratification was also correlated with elevated PTOC:PNew. In the most productive, inshore region, PTOC exceeded previously reported sinking export rates, which identified TOC as a quantitatively significant repository of exportable carbon in the CCE. However the sum of PTOC and sinking export for these productive regions was less than both PNew and oxygen-based estimates of net community production. These results imply that nonsinking reservoirs alone are not sufficient to explain observed imbalances between production and export for the most productive CCE regions.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0424; AR2019 Type: 10.1029/2018GB005930","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlation and linear regression analyses indicated that the declining trend infish abundance was correlated with a suite of factors: reduced offshore andincreased inshore upwelling; a long term warming trend combined with more recentinterannual variability in ocean temperature; weaker eddy kinetic energy north ofPoint Conception (35°N), potentially indicating reduced transport of the CaliforniaCurrent (CC); increased influence of the California Undercurrent (CUC); and adecline in zooplankton displacement volume across the southern CCS.

These layers of heightened chlorophyll and/or phytoplankton concentrations are generally thought to be a consequence of a balance between light energy from above and a limiting nutrient flux from below, typically nitrate (NO3). Here we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that iron (Fe) limits or with light colimits phytoplankton communities in SCMLs along a primary productivity gradient from coastal to oligotrophic offshore waters in the southern California Current ecosystem. SCML phytoplankton responded markedly to added Fe or Fe/light in experimental incubations and transcripts of diatom and picoeukaryote Fe stress genes were strikingly abundant in SCML metatranscriptomes. Using a biogeochemical proxy with data from a 40-y time series, we find that diatoms growing in California Current SCMLs are persistently Fe deficient during the spring and summer growing season.We also find that the spatial extent of Fe deficiency within California Current SCMLs has significantly increased over the last 25 y in line with a regional climate index. Finally, we show that diatom Fe deficiency may be common in the subsurface of major upwelling zones worldwide. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of marine SCML formation and maintenance.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","13300-13305","","52","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0434; AR2019 Type: 10.1073/pnas.1813192115","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintaining predator–prey relationships through protection of pelagic hotspots is crucial for conservation and manage-ment of living marine resources. Biotic components of pelagic, plankton- based, ecosystems exhibit high variability in abundance in time and space (i.e., extreme patchiness), requiring  investigation of persistence of abundance across trophic levels to resolve trophic hotspots. Using a 26- yr record of indicators for primary production, secondary (zooplankton and larval ﬁsh), and tertiary (seabirds) consumers, we show distributions of trophic hotspots in the south-ern California Current Ecosystem result from interactions between a strong upwelling center and a productive retention zone with enhanced nutrients, which concentrate prey and preda-tors across multiple trophic levels. Trophic hotspots also overlap with human impacts, includ-ing ﬁsheries extraction of coastal pelagic and groundﬁsh species, as well as intense commercial shipping trafﬁc. Spatial overlap of trophic hotspots with ﬁsheries and shipping increases  vulnerability of the ecosystem to localized depletion of forage ﬁsh, ship strikes on marine  mammals, and pollution. This study represents a critical step toward resolving pelagic areas of high conservation interest for planktonic ecosystems and may serve as a model for other ocean  regions where ecosystem- based management and marine spatial planning of pelagic ecosystems is warranted.","2017","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","560-574","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0335; AR2017,FRII2017 Type: 10.1002/eap.1466","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimentally derived rates can be challenging to interpret when methodological assumptions are untested or potentially violated under variable natural conditions, such as the assumed linear grazing response of the dilution technique for estimating rates of phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing impact. Here, we show that grazing nonlinearity can be related to the ratio of initial phytoplankton biomass to the half-saturation parameter in the Holling II model, while not being affected by varying grazer biomass during dilution experiments. From this, we present theory to recover growth and grazing rates from multi-treatment dilution experiments with nonlinear grazing results. We test our analyses with data collected during the California Current Ecosystem-Long-Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) program. We show that using a linear regression in 2-treatment dilution experiments may lead to underestimates of microzooplankton grazing rates, particularly in high-phytoplankton-biomass coastal regions where grazing can be saturated. Using the Holling II grazing model and a correction factor, growth and grazing rates from 2-treatment experiments can also be estimated, as illustrated by application to Lagrangian watertracking studies of growth and grazing dynamics in the CCE.","2017","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1825-1835","","5","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0385; AR2017,FRII2017 Type: 10.1002/lno.10536","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find a reproducible pattern of body sizedependence of day and night depths occupied, and of DVM. Both the smallest surface-dwelling and the largest deeper-dwelling copepods refrain from migrations, while intermediate-sized individuals show pronounced DVM. This pattern apparently arises as a consequence of size-dependent predation risk. In the size classes of migratory copepods the amplitude of DVM is further modulated by optical attenuation in the ocean water column because increased turbidity decreases encounter rates with visually hunting predators. Long-term changes in the ocean optical environment are expected to alter the vertical distributions of many copepods and thus to affect predator-prey encounters as well as oceanic carbon export.","2016","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","765-770","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0346; AR2016 Type: 10.1002/lno.10251","","","","CCE; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have built a new sediment trap that analyzes the collected material in situ, eliminating the need to preserve and store the samples. This new instrument, the Sedimentation Event Sensor (SES), captures macro images of the sample with front and back lighting, and takes fluorometric measurements in two bands as proxies for the presence of chlorophyll a and accessory pigments. The SES can process 6200 samples during a single deployment, which is the equivalent of 15 samples per day for more than a year. Here, we describe the design of the SES and present the results of its first three deployments at 3910 m depth. Images and fluorometry data revealed high variability of sinking particulate matter composition on the order of hours. Sedimentation patterns detected by the SES largely agreed with mass flux patterns measured from traditional traps deployed concurrently nearby. Given the functional differences, the SES is best used to complement rather than replace traditional sediment traps.","2016","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","853-863","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0386; AR2017,FRII2017 Type: 10.1002/lom3.10131","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Persistence statistics may reduce uncertainty about seabird habitat use, improve understanding of the spatio-temporal scales of pelagic food web dynamics, and inform conservation planning. Using 26 years (1987–2012, 47 surveys) of shipboard surveys from a 300K km2 study area within the southern California Current Ecosystem, we conduct a spatial assessment of the inter-annual and seasonal dynamics of the persistence of seabird hotspots and identify recurring sites of elevated seabird species richness and abundance. Previous studies document declines in abundance, but were based on broad spatial standardizations to assess where declines may have occurred. Here, we refine the hypothesis that seabird populations have declined off southern California by focusing on persistently used habitats in nearshore or offshore domains. We demonstrate that spatio-temporal variability of seabird distribution and abundance is characterized by anomalous events embedded within trends. In addition to identifying the locations of persistence of seabird aggregations, we found significant declines in species richness and the density of sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus) and Leach’s storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa); in contrast, black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) abundance appear to be increasing. This assessment provides a spatially-explicit framework for future evaluations of biophysical drivers of seabird hotspots and their associations and impacts on forage fish and zooplankton populations.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","214","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0345; AR2016","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), for example, is the only Pacific Ocean program in which the zooplankton and micronekton are resolved to species with consistent time series of greater than 20 years duration. Several studies now indicate massive changes to nearshore, mesopelagic and other fish communities of the southern California Current but available time series do not allow these potential changes to be examined more widely.

A strong positive trend in nitrate ﬂux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat ﬂux. Increased upwelling and nitrate ﬂux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual ﬂuctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published ﬁndings suggests that local wind intensiﬁcation persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes. Understanding the different time scales of variability in forcing mechanisms, and their interactions with each other, is necessary to distinguish transient ecosystem impacts from secular trends.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","5950-5957","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0324; AR2016 Edition: 24 July 2015 Type: 10.1002/2015GL065147","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary product of ocean color sensors is spectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). We found significant differences (13–18% median absolute percent error) between Rrs estimates at 443 nm of different satellite sensors. These differences in Rrs are transferred to inherent optical properties and further on to estimates of NPP. We estimated NPP for the California Current region from three ocean color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS) using a regionally optimized absorption based primary production model (Aph-PP) of Lee et al. (2011). Optimization of the Aph-PP model was required for each individual satellite sensor in order to make NPP estimates from different sensors compatible with each other. While the concept of Aph-PP has advantages over traditional chlorophyll-based NPP models, in practical application even the optimized Aph-PP model explained less than 60% of the total variance in NPP which is similar to other NPP algorithms. Uncertainties in satellite Rrs estimates as well as uncertainties in parameters representing phytoplankton depth distribution and physiology are likely to be limiting our current capability to accurately estimate NPP from space. Introducing a generic vertical profile for phytoplankton improved slightly the skill of the Aph-PP model.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","94-102","","","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0296; AR2015 Edition: 11 June 2014 Type: 10.1016/j.jmarsys.2014.06.003","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CALCOFI; CCE; P0605; P0704; P0810; P1106; P1208; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oligotrophic offshore waters create cross-shore gradients of biological and physical properties, which are affected by intense mesoscale eddy activity. The influence of eddies on ecosystem dynamics in EBUS is still in debate. To elucidate the mechanisms that influence the dynamics of ecosystems trapped in eddies, and the relative contribution of horizontal and vertical advection in determining local production, we analyze a particular cyclonic eddy using Lagrangian particle-tracking analyses of numerical Eulerian. The eddy formed in a coastal upwelling system; coastal waters trapped in the eddy enabled it to leave the upwelling region with high concentrations of plankton and nutrients. The ecosystem was initially driven mainly by recycling of biological material. As the eddy moved offshore, production in its core was enhanced compared to eddy exterior waters through Ekman pumping of nitrate from below the euphotic zone; this Ekman pumping was particularly effective due to the shallow nitracline in the eddy compared to eddy exterior waters. Both eddy trapping and Ekman pumping helped to isolate and maintain the ecosystem productivity in the eddy core. This study shows the importance of cyclonic eddies for biological production in EBUS: they contribute both to the redistribution of the coastal upwelling ecosystem and are local regions of enhanced new production. Together, these processes impact cross-shore gradients of important biological properties.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","5566-5588","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0339; AR2016 Type: 10.1002/2015JC010826","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this simplifying principle, we investigated how interactions between trophic levels, resource concentration, and physiological rates structure the planktonic community. Specifically, we used 3 size-structured nutrient-phytoplankton- zooplankton models differing in their trophic interactions, ranging from herbivorous grazing on one size class to omnivorous grazing on multiple size classes. We parameterized our models based on an extensive review of the literature. The maximum phytoplankton growth, maximum microzooplankton grazing, and phytoplankton half-saturation constant were found to vary inversely with size, and the nutrient half-saturation constant scaled positively with size. We examined the emergent community structure in our models under 4 nutrient regimes: 10, 20, 25, and 30 μM total N. In all models under all nutrient conditions, the normalized biomass of both phytoplankton and microzooplankton decreased with increasing size. As nutrients were in creased, phytoplankton biomass was added to larger size classes with little change in the extant smaller size classes; for microzooplankton, spectra elongated and biomass was added to all size classes. The different grazing behaviors among models led to more subtle changes in the community structure. Overall, we found that phytoplankton are top-down controlled and microzooplankton are largely bottomup controlled. Sensitivity analyses showed that both phytoplankton and microzooplankton biomass vary strongly with the size-dependence of the maximum grazing rate. Therefore, this parameter must be known with the greatest accuracy, given its large influence on the emergent community spectra.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","13-33","","","514","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0302; AR2015 Type: 10.3354/meps10968","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New patterns continue to emerge showing that the deep-sea can be dynamic on short time scales, rather than static over long periods. In just over 2 years the community shifted from a sessile, suspension-feeding, sponge-dominated community to a mobile, detritus-feeding, sea cucumber-dominated assemblage. In 2006 megafaunal diversity (Simpson’s Diversity Index, SDI) was high, yet the community was depauperate in terms of density compared to later periods. Over an 18-month period beginning in spring 2011, the densities of mobile organisms increased by nearly an order of magnitude while diversity decreased below 2006 levels. In late 2012 four sea cucumbers (two Peniagone spp., Elpidia sp. A, and Scotoplanes globosa) were at the highest densities recorded since investigations began at Station M in 1989. For a group of 10 echinoderms investigated over the entire study period, we saw evidence of a long-term cycle spanning 2 decades. These changes can be tied to a variable food supply originating in shallow water. Large variations over decadal-scales indicate that remote abyssal communities are dynamic and likely subject to impacts from anthropogenic changes like ocean warming, acidification, and pollution manifested in the upper ocean. The degree of dynamism indicates that one-time or short-term investigations are not sufficient for assessing biological community structure in conservation or exploitation studies in the deep sea.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-11","","","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0349; AR2016 Type: 10.1016/j.pocean.2014.04.007","","","","CCE; Published; Sta M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","Scales of spatial heterogeneity of plastic marine debris in the northeast Pacific Ocean","PLOS ONE","","","","","Plastic debris has been documented in many marine ecosystems, including remote coastlines, the water column, the deep sea, and subtropical gyres. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), colloquially called the ‘‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch,’’ has been an area of particular scientific and public concern. However, quantitative assessments of the extent and variability of plastic in the NPSG have been limited. Here, we quantify the distribution, abundance, and size of plastic in a subset of the eastern Pacific (approximately 20–40uN, 120–155uW) over multiple spatial scales. Samples were collected in Summer 2009 using surface and subsurface plankton net tows and quantitative visual observations, and Fall 2010 using surface net tows only. We documented widespread, though spatially variable, plastic pollution in this portion of the NPSG and adjacent waters. The overall median microplastic numerical concentration in Summer 2009 was 0.448 particles m22 and in Fall 2010 was 0.021 particles m22, but plastic concentrations were highly variable over the submesoscale (10 s of km). Size-frequency spectra were skewed towards small particles, with the most abundant particles having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.01 cm2. Most microplastic was found on the sea surface, with the highest densities detected in low-wind conditions. The numerical majority of objects were small particles collected with nets, but the majority of debris surface area was found in large objects assessed visually. Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology, as stations with substantial microplastic did not necessarily also contain large visually observable objects. A power analysis of our data suggests that high variability of surface microplastic will make future changes in abundance difficult to detect without substantial sampling effort. Our findings suggest that assessment and monitoring of oceanic plastic debris must account for high spatial variability, particularly in regards to the evaluation of initiatives designed to reduce marine debris.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","e80020","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0269 Type: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080020","","","","CCE; NPSG; Published; Seaplex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This north–south gradient, which we called A-Front, was formed by the eastward flow of the California Current and separated cooler mesotrophic waters of coastal upwelling origin to the north, from warm oligotrophic waters of likely mixed subarctic–subtropical origin to the south. Plankton biomass and phytoplankton growth rates were two to three times greater on the northern side, and primary production rates were elevated 5-fold to the north. Compared with either of the adjacent waters, the frontal interface was strongly enriched and uniquely defined by a subsurface bloom of large diatoms, elevated concentrations of suspension-feeding zooplankton, high bioacoustical estimates of pelagic fish and enhanced bacterial production and phytoplankton biomass and photosynthetic potential. Such habitats, though small in areal extent, may contribute disproportionately and importantly to regional productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon fluxes and trophic ecology. As a general introduction to the A-Front study, we provide an overview of its design and implementation, a brief summary of major findings and a discussion of potential mechanisms of plankton enrichment at the front.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","739-748","","9","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0207 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbs025","","","","CCE; Datazoo 181; P0810; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three of the four drifter studies were within the coastal upwelling regime and one drifter study was in a warm-core anticyclonic eddy. Incubation bottle experiments were also conducted to determine the degree of phytoplankton Fe limitation and to assess changes in the concentration of Fe-binding ligands. In the coastal upwelling drifter studies, in situ dFe (1.4–1.8nM) and macronutrients were initially high and declined over time. Fe addition incubation experiments indicated that the phytoplankton community was not Fe limited at the beginning of the coastal upwelling drifter experiments (when μM nitrate:nM dFe ratios were ~7–8). By the end of two of the three drifter studies (when μM nitrate:nM dFe ratios were ~12–19), Fe addition resulted in larger nitrate and silicic acid drawdown, and larger accumulations in chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and diatom and dinoflagellate-specific carotenoid pigments. Fe speciation was measured in situ in three of the four drifter studies with stronger L1-type ligands found to be present in excess of dFe in all samples. In Fe speciation incubation experiments, L1-type ligand production was observed in conjunction with phytoplankton growth under Fe-limiting conditions. The results presented here support and add a quasi-Lagrangian perspective to previous observations of dFe and macronutrient cycling over space and time within the California coastal upwelling regime, including Fe limitation within the phytoplankton community in this region and the biological production of Fe-binding ligands concomitant with Fe limitation.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-12","","","128-129","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","Pubget","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0197 ISBN: 0304-4203 Type: 10.1016/j.marchem.2011.11.001","","","","CCE; Datazoo 181; P0605; P0704; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This perception is based primarily on a few case studies and anecdotal evidence, but a formal analysis of global temporal trends in jellyfish populations has been missing. Here, we analyze all available long-term datasets on changes in jellyfish abundance across multiple coastal stations, using linear and logistic mixed models and effect-size analysis to showthat there is norobust evidence for a global increase in jellyfish. Although there has been a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s, this trend was unsubstantiated by effect-size analysis that showed no difference in the proportion of increasing vs. decreasing jellyfish populations over all time periods examined. Rather, the strongest nonrandom trend indicated jellyfish populations undergo larger, worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20-y periodicity, including a rising phase during the 1990s that contributed to the perception of a global increase in jellyfish abundance. Sustained monitoring is required over the next decade to elucidate with statistical confidence whether the weak increasing linear trend in jellyfish after 1970 is an actual shift in the baseline or part of an oscillation. Irrespective of the nature of increase, given the potential damage posed by jellyfish blooms to fisheries, tourism, and other human industries, our findings foretell recurrent phases of rise and fall in jellyfish populations that society should be prepared to face.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1000-1005","","3","110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: External data user #1 Type: 10.1073/pnas.1210920110","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo ?; External_data_user; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historical inorganic carbon measurements are scarce, so the progression of OA in the CCS is unknown. We used a multiple linear regression approach to generate empirical models using oxygen (O2), temperature (T), salinity (S), and sigma theta (σθ) as proxy variables to reconstruct pH, carbonate saturation states, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and total alkalinity (TA) in the southern CCS. The calibration data included high-quality measurements of carbon, oxygen, and other hydrographic variables, collected during a cruise from British Columbia to Baja California in May–June 2007. All resulting empirical relationships were robust, withr2values >0.92 and low root mean square errors. Estimated and measured carbon chemistry matched very well for independent data sets from the CalCOFI and IMECOCAL programs. Reconstructed CCS pH and saturation states for 2005–2011 reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the upper water column. Deeper in the water column, conditions are stable throughout the annual cycle, with perennially low pH and saturation states. Over sub-decadal time scales, these empirical models provide a valuable tool for reconstructing carbonate chemistry related to ocean acidification where direct observations are limited. However, progressive increases in anthropogenic CO2 content of southern CCS water masses must be carefully addressed to apply the models over longer time scales.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","C05033","","C5","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0270 ISBN: 2156-2202 Type: 10.1029/2011JC007511","","","","1615 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modeling; 1635 Oceans; 4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modeling; 4806 Carbon cycling; 4835 Marine inorganic chemistry; CCE; California Current System; Published; aragonite saturation; carbonate chemistry; carbonate saturation; ocean acidification; pH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.","2010-07","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1923-1935","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0137 ISI:000278308100003 ISBN: 1354-1013 Type: 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02194.x","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate forcing can alter nutrient availability and predator community composition, and here we show that these shifts may dramatically alter plankton trophic structure, size distributions and biomass. We modeled phytoplankton and zooplankton as a highly resolved size spectrum with size-dependent nutrient uptake and predation and analyzed the model both as a size spectrum and as a food web. Model results identified 2 distinct regimes defined by the average zooplankton feeding preferences. Regime I communities, where planktonic predators are specialists or large relative to prey, had low omnivory, many top predators, low connectance and relatively flat size spectra. Regime II communities, where predators are generalists or small relative to prey, had a high degree of omnivory, no top predators, high connectance and steep size spectra. Model ecosystems with generalist predators had lower size diversity, smaller plankton and gappier size distributions than ecosystems with specialist predators. Nutrient availability had little influence on trophic structure but strongly impacted size structure and biomass. Most surprisingly, phytoplankton biomass sometimes decreased with added nutrients if predators were small relative to prey, implying that both predators and nutrients mediate shifts between bottom-up and top-down control. Based on our synthesized estimates of size-selective feeding parameters, we infer that size and trophic structure should be strongly affected by abundances of generalist, bloom-forming taxa such as salps and jellyfish, many of which are responsive to ocean temperature. Size-selective feeding fundamentally affects community structure and is a likely mechanism of change in planktonic ecosystems where community composition varies with temperature.","2010","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1-15","","","413","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0097 ISI:000281566900001 ISBN: 0171-8630 Type: 10.3354/meps08716","","","","CCE LTER; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential for their prediction in the ocean and possible management depends upon the characteristics of the regime shifts: their drivers (from anthropogenic to natural), scale (from the local to the basin) and potential for management action (from adaptation to mitigation). We present a conceptual framework that will enhance our ability to detect, predict and manage regime shifts in the ocean, illustrating our approach with three welldocumented examples: the North Pacific, the North Sea and Caribbean coral reefs. We conclude that the ability to adapt to, or manage, regime shifts depends upon their uniqueness, our understanding of their causes and linkages among ecosystem components and our observational capabilities.","2008","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","402-409","","7","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: External data user #2 Type: 10.1016/j.tree.2008.03.008","","","","Aug_CalCOFI; CCE; Datazoo 155; External_data_user; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
