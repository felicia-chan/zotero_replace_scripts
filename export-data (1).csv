Conventional net sampling techniques are unable to resolve this vertical microstructure, while optical imaging systems can measure it for limited durations. Zooglider, an autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider, uses a low-power optical imaging system (Zoocam) to resolve mesozooplankton at a vertical scale of 5 cm while making concurrent physical and acoustic measurements (Zonar). In March 2017, Zooglider was compared with traditional nets (MOCNESS) and ship-based acoustics (Simrad EK80). Zoocam recorded significantly higher vertically integrated abundances of smaller copepods and appendicularians, and larger gelatinous predators and mineralized protists, but similar abundances of chaetognaths, euphausiids, and nauplii. Differences in concentrations and size-frequency distributions are attributable to net extrusion and preservation artifacts, suggesting advantages of in situ imaging of organisms by Zooglider. Zoocam detected much higher local concentrations of copepods and appendicularians (53 000 and 29 000 animals m−3, respectively) than were resolvable by nets. The EK80 and Zonar at 200 kHz agreed in relative magnitude and distribution of acoustic backscatter. The profiling capability of Zooglider allows for deeper high-frequency acoustic sampling than conventional ship-based acoustics.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","521-533","","4","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0455; AR2020 Type: 10.1093/plankt/fbz033","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fixatives further distort organisms. In situ imaging of zooplankton from a fully autonomous Zooglider reveals a suite of trait characteristics that often differ markedly from those inferred from conventionally sampled plankton. In situ images show fragile feeding appendages in natural hunting postures, including reticulate networks of rhizopods, feeding tentacles of cnidarians, and tentilla of ctenophores; defensive spines and setae of copepods; intact mucous houses of appendicularians; and other structures that are not discernible in conventionally collected zooplankton. Postures characteristic of dormant copepods can be identified and the presence of egg sacs detected. Intact, elongate diatom chains that are much longer than measured in sampled specimens are resolvable in situ. The ability to image marine snow, as well as small-scale fluid deformations, reveals micro-habitat structure that may alter organismal  behaviour.

We developed or improved applications of 3 ecosystem modeling  approaches: Ecopath, Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE), and Atlantis. We also used Ecopath diets to predict impacts to predators using a statistical  generalization of the dynamic Ecosim model (Predator Response to the Exploitation of Prey [PREP]). Models that included brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis at the species level (MICE and Ecopath/PREP) both predict moderate to high vulnerability of brown pelicans to low sardine abundance. This vulnerability arises because sardine comprises a large fraction of their diet, and because other important prey (anchovy) also exhibit large population fluctuations. Two of the  ecosystem models (MICE and Atlantis) suggest that California sea lions Zalophus californianus exhibit relatively minor responses to sardine depletion, due to having broader diets and lower reliance on another fluctuating species, anchovy. On the other hand, Ecopath/PREP suggests that sardine declines will have a stronger impact on California sea lions. This discrepancy may in part reflect structural differences in the models: Atlantis and MICE explicitly represent density dependence and age-structure, which can mitigate effects of prey depletion in these models. Future work should identify fisheries management strategies that are robust to uncertainties within and among models, rather than relying on single models to assess ecosystem impacts of management and forage fish abundance.","2019","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","307-321","","","617-618","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0412; AR2018 Edition: April 17, 2018 Type: 10.3354/meps12504","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also hypothesized that copepods would show increased rates of egg production and recruitment in association with ocean fronts. Three species of copepods (Calanus pacificus, Metridia pacifica, and Eucalanus californicus) were incubated at sea in simulated in situ conditions to ascertain egg production rates and egg hatching success during a sequence of 3–5 California Current Ecosystem-Long Term Ecological Research (CCELTER) cruises across diverse ocean conditions. Several indices of food availability were measured. The warm events had no significant effect on egg production rates measured in the experiments conducted here. Egg production and net naupliar production rates varied markedly among copepod species and across spatial gradients, but relationships with food concentration during warm events did not consistently diverge from functional relationships during El Niño-neutral conditions. Egg production was most commonly elevated inshore compared to offshore, but was not elevated within fronts. The egg production of C. pacificus was best explained by total Chl-a, while E. californicus was best explained by the > 20 size fraction of Chl-a. M. pacifica showed no relationship between egg production and any food metric tested.

The recent occurrence of a warm anomaly (2014–2015) followed by an El Niño (2015–2016) in the southern sector of the California Current System presented an opportunity to analyze changes in the biological carbon pump in response to altered climate forcing. We compare primary production, mesozooplankton grazing, and carbon export from the euphotic zone during quasi-Lagrangian experiments conducted in contrasting conditions: two cruises during warm years - one during the warm anomaly in 2014 and one toward the end of El Niño 2016 – and three cruises during El Niñoneutral years. Results showed no substantial differences in the relationships between vertical carbon export and its presumed drivers (primary production, mesozooplankton grazing) between warm and neutral years. Mesozooplankton fecal pellet enumeration and phaeopigment measurements both showed that fecal pellets were the dominant contributor to export in productive upwelling regions. In more oligotrophic regions, fluxes were dominated by amorphous marine snow with negligible pigment content. We found no evidence for a significant shift in the relationship between mesozooplankton grazing rate and chlorophyll concentration. However, massspecific grazing rates were lower at low-to-moderate chlorophyll concentrations during warm years relative to neutral years. We also detected a significant difference in the relationship between phytoplankton primary production and photosynthetically active radiation between years: at similar irradiance and nutrient concentrations, productivity decreased during the warm events. Whether these changes resulted from species composition changes remains to be determined. Overall, our results suggest that the processes driving export remain similar during different climate conditions, but that species compositional changes or other structural changes require further attention.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","52-62","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0404; RR2018, AR2018 Type: 10.1016/j.dsr.2018.07.012","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In marine ecosystems, the role of bottom-up and top-down forcing has been shown to vary over spatiotemporal scales, often linked to highly variable and heterogeneously distributed environmental conditions. Ecosystem dynamics in the Northeast Pacific have been suggested to be predominately bottom-up regulated. However, it remains unknown to what extent top-down regulation occurs, or whether the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down forcing may shift in response to climate change. In this study, we investigate the effects and relative importance of bottom-up, top-down, and physical forcing during changing climate conditions on ecosystem regulation in the Southern California Current System (SCCS) using a generalized food web model. This statistical approach is based on nonlinear threshold models and a long-term data set (~60 years) covering multiple trophic levels from phytoplankton to predatory fish. We found bottom-up control to be the primary mode of ecosystem regulation. However, our results also demonstrate an alternative mode of regulation represented by interacting bottom-up and top-down forcing, analogous to waspwaist dynamics, but occurring across multiple trophic levels and only during periods of reduced bottom-up forcing (i.e., weak upwelling, low nutrient concentrations, and primary production). The shifts in ecosystem regulation are caused by changes in ocean-atmosphere forcing and triggered by highly variable climate conditions associated with El Nino. Furthermore, we show that biota respond differently to major El Nino events during positive or negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), as well as highlight potential concerns for marine and fisheries management by demonstrating increased sensitivity of pelagic fish to exploitation during El Nino.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","796-809","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0397; RR2018 Type: 10.1111/gcb.13993","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although total mesozooplankton carbon biomass was only modestly affected during El Niño springs, community composition changed substantially. Carbon biomass of five major zooplankton taxa correlated negatively with San Diego sea level anomaly (SDSLA), a regional metric of El Niño physical impacts in the CCS. Additional taxa were negatively related to SDSLA via a time-lagged response reflected in an autoregressive-1 (AR-1) model. All five SDSLAcorrelated taxa decreased in carbon biomass during most El Niño years compared to the surrounding years; the exception was the mild event of 2003. Principal Component Analysis revealed coherent species-level responses to El Niño within the euphausiids, copepods, and hyperiid amphipods. Percent similarity index (PSI) comparisons showed pronounced changes in the compositions of euphausiid and, to a lesser extent, calanoid copepod communities during El Niño. By grouping El Niños into Eastern Pacific (EP) versus Central Pacific (CP) events based on their expressions along the equator, we found that CCS zooplankton assemblages showed a tendency toward greater changes in species composition during EP than CP El Niños, although we had low statistical power for these comparisons. Several species showed consistent biomass changes across La Niña events as well, generally opposite in sign to El Niño responses, but overall community composition showed minimal change during La Niña. Carbon biomass and community composition returned to pre-Niño levels within 1–2 years following almost every event, suggesting high resilience of southern CCS zooplankton to El Niño perturbations to date.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","36-51","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0403; RR2018 Type: 10.1016/j.dsr.2018.07.015","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given theinﬂuence of fronts on the functioning of marine ecosystems, an improved understanding of the spatial andtemporal variability of frontal activity is desirable. Here, we document changes in the frequency of sea-surfacefronts and the surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in the California Current System that occurredduring the Northeast Paciﬁc anomalous warming of 2014–2015 and El Niño of 2015–2016, and place thoseanomalies in the context of two decades of variability. Frontal frequency was detected with the automatedhistogram method using datasets of sea-surface temperature (SST) and Chla from multiple satellite sensors.During the anomalous 2014–2016 period, a drop in the frequency of fronts coincided with the largest negativeChla anomalies and positive SST anomalies in the whole period of satellite observations (1997–2017 for Chlaand 1982–2017 for SST). These recent reductions in frontal frequency ran counter to a previously reportedincreasing trend, though it remains to be seen if they represent brief interruptions in that trend or a reversal that will persist going forward.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","4-13","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0400; RR2018, AR2018 Type: 10.1016/j.dsr.2018.04.007","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along oceanic eastern boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth’srotation combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a process calledEkman transport. Similarly,positive wind stress curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and consequently upwelling frombelow, a process known asEkman suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling of relativelynutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form thebase of the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies the calculation of upwelling indicessuch as the“Bakun Index”that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system studies. While generallyvaluablefirst-order descriptions, these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete pictureof coastal upwelling. Here we review the relevant dynamics and limitations of classical upwelling indices,particularly related to representation of the surface wind stress, the influence of geostrophic currents, and theproperties of upwelled water. To address these shortcomings, we present two new upwelling indices forthe U.S. West Coast (31–47°N), which are available from 1988 to present. The Coastal Upwelling TransportIndex and the Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index provide improved estimates of verticaltransport and vertical nitrateflux, respectively, by leveraging technological and scientific advances realizedsince the introduction of the Bakun Index nearly a half century ago.","2018","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","7332-7350","","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0431; AR2019 Type: 10.1029/2018JC014187","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comparison of conditions across the 154 positive frontal gradients (i.e., where density of the surface layer decreased in the offshore direction) identified from six years of continuous measurements showed that waters on the denser side of the fronts typically showed higher Chl-a fluorescence, shallower euphotic zones, and higher acoustic backscatter than waters on the less dense side. Transitions between these regions were relatively abrupt. For positive fronts the amplitude of Diel Vertical Migration (DVM), inferred from a 3-beam 750 kHz acoustic Doppler profiler, increased offshore of fronts and covaried with optical transparency of the water column. Average interbeam variability in acoustic backscatter also changed across many positive fronts within 3 depth strata (0–150 m, 150–400 m, and 400–500 m), revealing a front-related change in the acoustic scattering characteristics of the assemblages. The extent of vertical stratification of distinct scattering assemblages was also more pronounced offshore of positive fronts. Depth-stratified zooplankton samples collected by Mocness nets corroborated the autonomous measurements, showing copepod-dominated assemblages and decreased zooplankton body sizes offshore and euphausiid-dominated assemblages with larger median body sizes inshore of major frontal features.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","77-92","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0317; AR2015 Edition: 24 Dec 2014 ISBN: 0079-6611 Type: doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2014.12.011","","","","CCE; P0605; P0704; P0810; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results revealed that, between 2004 and 2010, coastal regions of mainland Tanzania inhabited by approximately 21% of the total population accounted for approximately 50% of the cholera cases and 40% of the total mortality. Significant co-variations were found between seasonally adjusted cholera cases and coastal ocean chlorophyll a and, to some degree, sea surface temperature, the outbreaks lagging behind by one to four months. Cholera cases in Dar es Salaam were also weakly related to the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index, lagging by five months, suggesting that it may be possible to predict cholera outbreaks for Dar es Salaam this period ahead. The results also suggest that the severity of cholera in coastal regions can be predicted by ocean conditions and that longer-term environmental and climate parameters may be used to predict cholera outbreaks along the coastal regions.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","93-105","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0337; AR2016","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oceans","","","","","A key goal in understanding the ocean’s biogeochemical state is estimation of rates of change of critical tracers, particularly components of the planktonic ecosystem. Unfortunately, because ship survey data are not synoptic, it is difficult to obtain spatially resolved estimates of the rates of change of tracers sampled in a moving fluid. Here we present a pseudo-Lagrangian transformation to remap data from underway surveys to a pseudo-synoptic view. The method utilizes geostrophic velocities to back advect and relocate sampling positions, removing advection aliasing. This algorithm produces a map of true relative sampling locations, and allows for determination of the relative locations of observations acquired along streamlines, as well as a corrected view of the tracer’s spatial gradients. We then use a forward advection scheme to estimate the tracer’s relative change along streamlines, and use these to calculate spatially resolved, net specific rates of change. Application of this technique to Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence data around an ocean front is presented. We obtain 156 individual estimates of Chl-a fluorescence net specific rate of change, covering !1200 km2. After incorporating a diffusion-like model to estimate error, the method shows that the majority of observations (64%) were significantly negative. This pseudo-Lagrangian approach generates more accurate spatial maps than raw survey data, and allows spatially resolved estimates of net rates of tracer change. Such estimates can be used as a rate budget constraint that, in conjunction with standard rate measurements, will better determine biogeochemical fluxes.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","4962-4979","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0342; AR2016 Type: 10.1002/2015JC010898","","","","CCE; P1208; Process_cruise; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, mesopelagic fish pose several challenges for acoustic biomass estimation based on their small size, wide depth range, mixed aggregations, and length-dependent acoustic reflectance, which differentiate them from the larger epipelagic and neritic fish for which these methods were developed. Foremost, there is a strong effect of depth on swimbladder resonance, so acoustic surveys of mesopelagic fish must incorporate depth-stratification. Additionally, the 1–3 cm juveniles of many species are not only more abundant, but can also be stronger acoustic backscatterers than the larger adults that comprise most of the biomass. The dominant species in terms of biomass may thus be weak acoustic backscatters. Failure to properly incorporate depth, the full size distribution, and certain less-abundant species into mesopelagic acoustic analyses could lead to errors in estimated biomass of up to three orders of magnitude. Thus, thorough validation, or “ground-truthing ”, of the species composition, depth structure, population size distribution, capture efficiency of the sampling device, and acoustic properties of the fish present is critical for credible acoustic estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass. This is not insurmountable, but requires more ancillary data than is usually collected.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","1413–1424","","5","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0314; AR2015 Type: 10.1093/icesjms/fsv023","","","","CCE; Process_cruise; Published; SEAPLEX","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","Climate change and decadal shifts in the phenology of larval fishes in the California Current ecosystem","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","","","","","Climate change has prompted an earlier arrival of spring in numerous ecosystems. It is uncertain whether such changes are occurring in Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling ecosystems, because these regions are subject to natural decadal climate variability, and regional climate models predict seasonal delays in upwelling. To answer this question, the phenology of 43 species of larval fishes was investigated between 1951 and 2008 off southern California. Ordination of the fish community showed earlier phenological progression in more recent years. Thirty-nine percent of seasonal peaks in larval abundance occurred earlier in the year, whereas 18% were delayed. The species whose phenology became earlier were characterized by an offshore, pelagic distribution, whereas species with delayed phenology were more likely to reside in coastal, demersal habitats. Phenological changes were more closely associated with a trend toward earlier warming of surface waters rather than decadal climate cycles, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Species with long-term advances and delays in phenology reacted similarly to warming at the interannual time scale as demonstrated by responses to the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The trend toward earlier spawning was correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and mesozooplankton displacement volume, but not coastal upwelling. SST and upwelling were correlated with delays in fish phenology. For species with 20th century advances in phenology, future projections indicate that current trends will continue unabated. The fate of species with delayed phenology is less clear due to differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models in projected upwelling trends.","2015","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","E4065-E4074","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0347; AR2016 Type: 10.1073/pnas.1421946112","","","","CALCOFI; CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun’s hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun’s hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","77-80","","6192","345","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0323; AR2015 Type: 10.1126/science.1251635","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zooplankton biomass showed contrasting long-term patterns in the two regions: an increasing trend (as wet mass) in the NeAMS, but a decreasing trend (as displacement volume) in the SCC. Zooplankton biomass covaried with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the NeAMS, but with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation in the SCC. In the NeAMS, increasing zooplankton biomass was closely associated with increases of all major zooplankton groups (copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, and hyperiid amphipods). In the SCC, decreasing zooplankton biomass was caused by declining tunicates and chaetognaths. Seasonal cycles and responses to El Niño also differed between the two regions. In this cross-basin comparison, zooplankton showed differing patterns that reflect region-specific physical and biotic processes rather than synchronous responses to large-scale atmosphere-ocean forcing.","2014","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","169-182","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0312; AR2015","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated coherence among temperature, salinity, depth of 26.0 potential density isopycnal, and stratification strength at regionally and monthly time scales derived from shipboard and mooring observations, and a data-assimilative Regional Ocean Model System reanalysis. The reanalysis captures spatiotemporal physical variability of coastal ocean conditions in winter and spring months and elucidates mechanisms connecting the spatial and temporal upwelling and transport dynamics on observed krill and rockfish abundances in spring.

Nonlinearities in the system prevent a complete 30-day fit, so two 15-day fits for 1–15 November and 16–30 November are executed using the available observations of hydrographic temperature and salinity, along with satellite fields of SST and sea-level height anomaly. The fits converge and reduce the cost function significantly, and the results indicated that ROMS is able to successfully reproduce both large-scale and smaller-scale features of the flows observed during the VOCALS-REx cruise. Particular attention is focused on an intensively studied eddy at 76° W, 19° S. The ROMS fits capture this eddy as an isolated rotating 3-D vortex with a strong subsurface signature in velocity, temperature and anomalously low salinity. The eddy has an average temperature anomaly of approximately −0.5 °C over a depth range from 50–600 m and features a cold anomaly of approximately −1 °C near 150 m depth. The eddy moves northwestward and elongates during the second 15-day fit. It exhibits a strong signature in the Okubo-Weiss parameter, which indicates significant nonlinearity in its evolution. The heat balance for the period of the cruise from the ocean state estimate reveals that the horizontal advection and the vertical mixing processes are the dominant terms that balance the temperature tendency of the upper layer of the ocean locally in time and space. Areal averages around the eddies, for a 15-day period during the cruise, suggest that vertical mixing processes generally balance the surface heating. Although, this indicates only a small role for lateral advective processes in this region during this period, this quasi-instantaneous heat budget analysis cannot be extended to interpret the seasonal or long-term upper ocean heat budget in this region.","2013","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","3329-3344","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0298 Type: 10.5194/acp-13-3329-2013","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of autonomous instrumentation, including underwater gliders, profiling floats, surface drifters, enhanced moorings, coastal high-frequency radars, and satellite remote sensing, now provides the capability to resolve such phenomena and assess their role in structuring pelagic ecosystems.

During another El Niño/Southern Oscillation transition period in 2006&#8211;2007 when the El Niño state retreated and the La Niña returned, a similar pattern in spawning habitat quality was seen. The coupling between the atmospheric forcing, the physical ocean states and the properties of the sardine egg spawning are investigated using dynamically consistent data-assimilation fits of the available physical oceanographic observations during these months. Fits were executed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional variational assimilation platform along with adjoint model runs using a passive tracer to deduce source waters for the areas of interest. Analysis using the data-assimilation model runs reveals that unusually strong equatorward wind-forcing drives offshore transport during the La Niña conditions, which extends the spawning habitat for sardine further offshore. A statistical model of sardine spawning habitat shows better habitat quality during the El Niño conditions, which is associated with higher egg densities and corresponded to higher daily egg production. Concentration of eggs is also increased by convergence of water. The results of the source waters analysis using the adjoint data assimilation model support the idea that offshore transport extends the spawning habitat, and show that higher levels of nutrient are brought into the spawning habitat with high concentration of sardine eggs.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","C03009","","C3","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0188 ISBN: 0148-0227 Type: 10.1029/2011jc007302","","","","4260 Oceanography: General: Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis (3225); 4522 Oceanography: Physical: ENSO (4922); 4815 Oceanography: Biological and Chemical: Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling (0439); CCE; CalCOFI; California Current System; Datazoo 78; El Niño/La Niña; Published; data assimilation; sardine spawning habitats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While several climatic fluctuation patterns influence the dynamics and biological productivity of the CCS, including the El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the mechanisms of interaction between climatic oscillations and the CCS upwelling dynamics have remained obscure. Here, we use Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to reveal, for the first time, low-frequency concordance between the time series of climatic indices and upwelling intensity along the coast of western North America. Based on energy distributions in annual, semiannual and low-frequency signals, we can divide the coast into three distinct regions. While the annual upwelling signal dominates the energy spectrum elsewhere, low-frequency variability is maximal in the regions south of 33uN. Non-structured variability associated with storms and turbulent mixing is enhanced at northerly locations. We found that the low-frequency signal is significantly correlated with different climatic indices such as PDO, NPGO and ENSO with the correlation patterns being latitude-dependent. We also analyzed the correlations between this upwelling variability and sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) throughout the North Pacific to visualize and interpret the large-scale teleconnection dynamics in the atmosphere that drive the low-frequency coastal winds. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms connecting climatic patterns with upwelling dynamics, which could enhance our prediction and forecast capabilities of the effects of future oceanographic and climatic variability in the CCS.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","13","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0183 Edition: January 19, 2012 Type: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030436","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biomass and community composition of non-VMF did not differ between the two sides of the front. The north was dominated by the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica and the myctophid Diaphus theta, whereas the south was dominated by E. gibboides, E. recurva and a combination of VMF species with warm water affinities.

Acoustic data revealed differences in the distribution of fish, euphausiids and the deep-scattering layer across the front. In particular, epipelagic fish were aggregated directly at the frontal interface in the area of enhanced plankton concentrations and may have contributed to higher plankton mortality and turnover rates at the front.

A cluster analysis of physical and chemical oceanographic data is used to classify coral habitats in the remote tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean based on average temperature, temperature seasonal cycle, nutrient levels, salinity, aragonite saturation state, storm frequency, intense hurricane hits, and dissolved oxygen as well as temperature anomalies in degree heating weeks. The resulting seven geographic habitats are stable to perturbations in types of data used in the cluster analysis. Based on recent coral reef survey data in the area, the coral cover was related to the identified geographic regions. The habitats tend to be geographically clustered, and each is characterized by a unique combination of oceanographic conditions. Previous studies suggest coral reef habitats are associated with a uniform array of oceanographic conditions, while our results demonstrate that finer-scale variations in physical variables may control coral reef environments. The results better define the physical environment of remote coral reefs, forming a foundation for future work addressing physical habitat perturbation and anthropogenic impacts on reefs.","2012","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","C02007","","C2","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0189 ISBN: 0148-0227 Type: 10.1029/2011jc007099","","","","0460 Biogeosciences: Marine systems (4800); 4273 Oceanography: General: Physical and biogeochemical interactions; 9355 Geographic Location: Pacific Ocean; CCE; Pacific; Published; biogeography; climate; cluster analysis; coral reef; physical oceanography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bloom levels of cells within the Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima group were detected on 6 July 2009 at 4 nearshore collection sites in the Southern California Bight (Scripps Pier, Newport Pier, Goleta Pier and Sterns Wharf). Particulate DA was detected in all of these locations, except for Newport Pier. Stranded Humboldt squid were found south of the Scripps pier 5 days after the toxic bloom was detected. DA was measured using ELISA and detected in the stomach or mantle tissue of the stranded specimens. Stomach content analysis indicated that possible DA vectors to Humboldt squid included both pelagic (Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax) and nearshore (pile surfperch, Damalichthys vacca, and shiner surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata) fish species.","2011","2022-12-16 19:26:41","2022-12-16T19:26:41Z","","109-115","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accession Number: CCE LTER Contribution #0173","","","","CCE; Published","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
